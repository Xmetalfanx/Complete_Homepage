		h4 Introduction

		p Hello, I'd like to give a little background about my  experience with Linux, before you start browsing my site, to get a sense for where I am coming from. For a number of years now , I have been using Linux to some degree, and  have been using it more and more, while using  Windows less and less.
		p I have recently found a number of Linux reviewers on Youtube that have  inspired me&#x9;to make a  page that hopefully can show that Linux is not something that is just  for programmers or advanced users.
		p Showing  Tutorials, My reviews (as well as others), and sites that have helped me over&#x9;the years, is TRUE goal I have with this section. The Linux related ideas I came up with to add to the main site started to get way out of hand to put in a "small section" so that's when I decided to do the split into TechHQ (former WIndows Section ... and still has some crossplatform stuff) and LinuxHQ.
