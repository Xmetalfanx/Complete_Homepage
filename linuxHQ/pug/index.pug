      | Hello, I'd like to give a little background about my experience with Linux, before you start browsing my site, to get a sense for where I am coming from. For a number of years now , I have been using Linux to some degree, and have been using it more and more, while using Windows less and less.

        | Showing Tutorials, My reviews (as well as others), and sites that have helped me over	the years, is TRUE goal I have with this section. The Linux related ideas I came up with to add to the main site started to get way out of hand to put in a "small section" so that's when I decided to do the split into TechHQ (former Windows Section ... and still has some cross-platform stuff) and LinuxHQ. This section has info on:
        br
        ul
          li Linux Desktop options including screenshots, system requirments, and info on what version is in what Linux Distrobution
          li Linux Distrobution information including currently supported release and desktop options and screenshots
          li Theming: Information on Linux Themes, Icon and Cursor packs to custom the look of your Linux desktop
