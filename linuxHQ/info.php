        <p class="boldUnderline">USB Part of Linux Distro Section</p>
        <p class="justified">This table was made when I noticed what programs I made bootable USBs was hit and miss... 
								Some programs even seemed to make the bootable USB of an ISO just fine, however, the distro installs would fail constantly ...
								same ISO ... same USB drive, made with a DIFFERENT program ... everything including the install works fine.

								This is not the "be all, end all" list of what works and doesn't work ... just a little note from my experience. This will hopefully lend a hand to 
								those having problems. My HOPE is that someone may see this and think "Oh .. 'Xmetal" also had issues with distroX and UNetBootin, 
								though he said 'programX" DID work with that distro .. I will try 'programX" out then
