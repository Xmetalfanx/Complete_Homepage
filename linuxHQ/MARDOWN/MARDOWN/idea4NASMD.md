## Goal

A "DYI NAS" .... REALLY its not a "real NAS" and data redundancy is not import ... it is sort of a way to put my external hdds (one at a time) on my network to be accessible by anything from any of my three (my Toshiba is still alive and kicking) computers and Pi 2.   

## My Idea

1.  Get a third Hub ... use that connected to my Pi2 and connect to the hdd THROUGH the Pi2 through various devices .... all I really need for this to work ( other than setting stuff like Samba up perhaps on the distro on the pi2) is a another hub since the Pi2 cant give enough power to the ext hdd(s.)

    ###Hub options atm

    #### Needs:
    A POWERED hub for a decent price-vs-value ... The charging stuff and number of ports is NOT IMPORTANT other than "bang for my buck"

    **REGARDLESS of what price you see by default there is only a $2 difference between where I'd get them**

    -   [Plugable USB 2.0 4-Port High Speed Charging Hub with 12.5W Power Adapter and BC 1.1 Charging Support](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005P2BY5I?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=ox_sc_act_title_1&smid=A3HIHADV23VGU1)

        - Not sure if I'd EVER need this "BC Charging thing" but I am not against getting a hub that has it
        - This I found is $2 cheaper thanks to the seller (who really is a nice guy ... even before this fact ) who is giving me a discount since i am a returning customer.  The debate between hubs was still a debate before this fact, though I was leaning a tad toward the hub listed below ... that $2 discount MAY switch me to this one.

    -   [Sabrent 7 Port USB 2.0 HUB + 2 Charging Ports with 5V/4A Power Adapter](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00R5ZA20G?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=ox_sc_act_title_2&smid=A3EFFHTP6B6TNZ)

        - This one caught my eye first ... it doesn't have that BC 1.1 standard though it has 7 ports + 2 "regular charging ports" ... it doesn't support that BC charging standard.

2.  INSTEAD of another hub, get another (despite having a few already without USb) another router WITH USB and HOPEFULLY the external hdd which cant be powered with the pi 2 without the hub due to power consumption ... can be powered by this new hypothetical router with USB support WITHOUT the need for another hub...

    -   if i'd need a hub to power the ext. hard drive WITH the router ... well SCREW THAT, thats against the ENTIRE POINT of the router idea.  i have NO PROBLEM just using the pi 2 which is usually always on anyway


---
**SUMMARY:**

My GOAL is a that DYI NAS and my ideas for the way I want to do this (I DO NOT WANT TO GO NUTTY ON THE PRICE) my options are

-   USB Hub to powered external hard drive connected to a Pi 2 which (whatever SD card I have in) is always on unless there is a bad storm and here in Florida I'd unplug most of my stuff despite my APC in that case ANYWAY (if there is bad storm nearby)  

-   Router with USb support ( IF THAT usb support could supply enough power for the ext HDD otherwise there is no point to the router "route")
