- Fixed the fonts to make them look better in Linux
- I have tweaked/fixed the CSS in the Distro sections to look better
- TO DO: Add Netrunner (both versions) and Neptune to the Distro Section AND actually put the Desktop Section up


++ **Introduction** ++

Hello, I'd like to give a little background about my experience with Linux, before you start browsing my site, to get a sense for where I am coming from. For a number of years now , I have been using Linux to some degree, and have been using it more and more, while using Windows less and less.


My Experience with Linux: Last Updated: February 17, 2015 6:38 PM

The first few distrobutions:

1. Red Hat:	6.2 and 7.0 (never got to a GUI on my Hardware at the time)
2. Suse: Suse 9.3 for a few months, then a few more months with Suse 10.x ... THEN YEARS LATER 13.1 and a few months 13.2
3. Slackware: About 2 years (with the help of a good friend) running 12.2 with manual kernel updates that I did myself AND a little bit of time in 14.x but not long

I have recently found a number of Linux reviewers on Youtube that have inspired me to make a page that hopefully can show that Linux is not something that is just for programmers or advanced users.

Showing Tutorials, My reviews (as well as others), and sites that have helped me over the years, is TRUE goal I have with this site, as a Linux Section to my first site ( http://xmetalfanx.x10.mx ) seems to be getting a more out of hand section, the more ideas I come up with.
