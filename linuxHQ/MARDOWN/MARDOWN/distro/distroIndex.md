This section contains pages with information on many top distributions of Linux.

Notes for right now

1. The list on the left is what I have for now, though the way I have the templates/css setup now, I can EASILY add more to the list with minimal effort
2. The reviewer URLs now only have links directly to the reviewer's Youtube Homepage...


`sudo apt-get install hexchat`

I plan on (if a reviewer has reviewed a distribution a few times, I will include as many as I can, to show how their opinions may have changed over time)
> 
>[1] IF A REVIEWER has not reviews a distro, I will leave the URL "as-is" (Just the way I have my templates setup, its easiest), THEREFORE just linking to the reviewers homepage (This is when the section is "complete") ..
