- Double check any page in any section because some of the pages were missing the top of the page needed for the template.

#Site TODO (Post Upload)
- Fix the Title tags 
	- The Titles "Xmetal's FOO Section - BAR page " - the FOO still reflects the old "layout" ... not all pages need update/changing, but some do ... 

- Go page by page and fix links and image links that were not fixed during the "Dreamweaver template to PHP Template" conversion MONTHS ago.
