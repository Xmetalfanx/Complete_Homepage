### Explaining the lists
-	The reason for the groups is that I cant decide on an exact order and within the group, my order of how much I like them can be shuffled up at times
-	This is assuming the computer/VM I am using the distro in question on, can COMFORTABLY support doing anything I'd want 
-	This is NOT "Out of the Box" experience ... heck that'd be hard to judge with Arch for example 
-	Not counting a few on this list, Desktops (DEs) are not named on purpose... The DE depends on the machine ... and my mood honestly ... really it doesn't matter unless noted
