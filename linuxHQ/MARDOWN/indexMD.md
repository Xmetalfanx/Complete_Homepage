[Adding Remarkable Markdown Editor to Linux Mint (and maybe other Ubuntu based distros](/linuxHQ/install_remarkable.html)


[Adding PPA's to Ubuntu based Systems - More complete list](/linuxHQ/tutorials/AddPPA_MD.html)

[Adding Windows 10 features (that work) to Windows 7](/windowsHQ/optAndTweak/win10featuresWin7.html)


*Please note these pages are not proofread (completely anyway)... or  spell checked ... these could be considered "beta" web-pages. 

They will be **CONSTANTLY** updated

###My TO DO's:

##### Linux Section

- Add Neptune, and both versions of Net Runner to the distro Section
- (Due to Debian issues) .... move the Makulu page to the "others" section ... it is based on Ubuntu now but used to be based on Debian
