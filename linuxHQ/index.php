          <p class="justified">Hello, I&#8217d like to give a little background about my  experience with Linux, before you start browsing my site, to get a sense for where I am coming from. For a number of years now , I have been using Linux to some degree, and  have been using it more and more, while using  Windows less and less.</p>

  				<p class="justified">I  have recently found a number of Linux reviewers on Youtube that have  inspired me	to make a  page that hopefully can show that Linux is not something that is just  for programmers or advanced users.</p>

  				<p class="justified">Showing  Tutorials, My reviews (as well as others), and sites that have helped me over	the years, is TRUE goal I have with this site, as a Linux  Section to my first site	( <A HREF="http://xmetalfanx.x10.mx/">http://xmetalfanx.x10.mx</A> ) seems to be getting a more out ofhand section, the more ideas I come up with.</p>
