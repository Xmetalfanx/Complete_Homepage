#My Experience


##Linux

###My First Three distributions

-	Red Hat 6, and some Red Hat 7 
	-	 Not alot of success, though


-	Suse 9.3

-	Slackware 12.2
	
	-	While this one was a bit of a learning curve, I have to thanks a close friend of mine for his help with Slackware
	-	I have to say my time in Slackware forced me to learn alot and when I got to installing distros like Gentoo, many of the steps such as compiling the kernel from source ... seemed VERY familiar, and was a 'non-issue"
