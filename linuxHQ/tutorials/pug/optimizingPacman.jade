h4 To backup

kbd sudo&nbsp;cp&nbsp;/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist&nbsp;mirrorlist.backup

h4 To restore

kbd sudo&nbsp;cp&nbsp;/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.backup&nbsp;mirrorlist

  li Filter the first 10 mirrors, sort them by download rate and save the results to /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist:

    kbd &nbsp;reflector&nbsp;--verbose&nbsp;-l&nbsp;10&nbsp;--sort&nbsp;rate&nbsp;--save&nbsp;/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist`

  li Rate the 100 most recently synchronized HTTP servers, sort them by download rate, and save to the file /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist:</p>
