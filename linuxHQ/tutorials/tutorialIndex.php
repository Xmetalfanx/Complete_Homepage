  <p>I am not sure if this page will contain the same tutorials as the New User Section, (I am
  leaning towards a "yes" on that... even though I'd like to avoid duplicate content)</p>

  <p>This section is probably for the moderate to advanced user, with more than just "what is a
  partition/how to partition" type tutorials ... at least that is my plan at the moment</p>

</div> <!-- Closes second column -->
</div> <!-- Closes the row ... what use to be mainBody in my CSS-->
