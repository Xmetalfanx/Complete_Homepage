h2 Upgrading Debian Stable (What you have to start with)
h3 *** DO THESE IN ORDER ***
h4 Update and Upgrade (Current Stable) to the newest it can be 


div Update the repository &quot;database&quot; 

  code sudo apt-get update



div Upgrade the system


  code sudo apt-get upgrade

  ul
    li Do a Distributuon upgrade 

    code sudo apt-get distr-upgrade

  ul
    li Now (it may not be needed, but I choose to do it) Reboot the computer


  p Get ready to upgrade to &quot;Testing&quot; 

  ul
    li Go into the Terminal and type in whats below to edit your &quot;sourcelist&quot;

    code sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list

ul
  li
    | Once the file is opened, go to the line where it says "CD_Rom" or something to that effect and comment it out by putting a " # " in front of the entire line.

    ul
      li The point of this is everytime you "sudo apt-get update" (without it being commented out), it will check to see if it can find the Flashdrive/CD-Rom/..etc ... this just tells the system not to check that
  li You will see something similar to the following lines


code    
  code deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian stable main contrib non-free<br />
    deb-src http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian stable main contrib non-free
  code deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ wheezy-updates main contrib non-free<br />
    deb-src http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ wheezy-updates main contrib non-free
  code deb http://security.debian.org/ wheezy/updates main contrib non-free<br />
