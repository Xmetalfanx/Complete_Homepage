	<h3>What is a Partition</h3>

	<p>(note: this does apply to MULTIPLE HARD DRIVES on one machine too)</p>
	<p>Think of your hard drive as a Pie or Pizza.</p>
	<p>Your drive is one single &ldquo;slice&rdquo; (the entire Pizza = one slice) ...Partitioning allows you to divide your drive into sections that do not &ldquo;have to be&rdquo;, the same size.  This is basically how you can run Windows and Linux on the same computer. Part of the drive is for Windows, and another part is for Linux. </p>
	<p>For the record UEFI and things that Microsoft installs now, that they did not use to, make things more complicated for me to explain but the idea still applies.  When you get into UEFI and more complicated stuff ...that is out of the scope of my understanding and also what I want to put here ... I INTEND to try to put this in laymans terms.</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>Many Linux installers have an  option that allows you to use the entire drive for Linux.</p><em><strong> If you do not watch what your doing, you CAN format the Windows side and lose your data.</strong></em>.
	<p>I am not saying "Be WORRIED"... just "Pay attention".   It is better to stop what your doing and double check if you're not sure.  Just take your time (remember &ldquo;everyone was new to Linux&rdquo; at some point) and read the instructions on what your doing.  If you follow this advice, you have nothing to worry about at all.</p>
	<p>Accidentally removing Windows is a common mistake (when there is one), that I personally see new users make during the partitioning step &hellip; ... mainly just because they did not simply pay attention to what was going on and read what the installer was telling them </p>

	
	<p class="font-weight-bold">*** THE POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS AS LONG AS YOU DO YOUR RESEARCH, AND DO NOT JUST &quot;BLINDLY CLICK&quot; THINGS WITHOUT READING WHAT YOU'RE DOING ... YOU WILL NOT HAVE ISSUES ... IT'S (IN MY OPINION) THE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT PAY ATTENTION AND JUST BLINDLY CLICK "NEXT" ALL THE TIME WHO RUN INTO PROBLEMS/HEADACHES</p>
