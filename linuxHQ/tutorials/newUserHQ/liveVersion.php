	      <p>A-ha !... This is one of the many places where a “ Live Version ” comes in. You can try Linux and see how you like it before you commit to anything.  IN FACT, I'd recommend playing with a distro for awhile and seeing if you like it before you do anything to your system.</p>
	      <p>In fact, in many distributions <span see="see" my="my" Common Terms="Common Terms" page="page" if="if" this="this" confuses="confuses" you="you" class="font-italics"></span>, running the "Live Version" is a good way to see if it supports your hardware.
	        <p>If everything 'plays nice' ( say your graphics card plays videos and your favorite Mp3s play) , then those same things will be fine when you INSTALL the distro in question, to your hard-drive.</p>

	    <div class="card-text">
	      <p>I want to bring up the fact that even if you install Linux but don't use it much..(though a live version works here too) … Linux is a GREAT way to get to your data if Windows has a “meltdown”. Some users are surprised ALL of their data is still there, even when Windows will not even boot into “safe mode”.</p>
	      <p>This can be
	        <div class="font-weight-italics">(example your in a rush and have to get to a report or other document on your hard drive, &quot;RIGHT NOW&quot;)</div>… you can “instantly get” to your data and then trouble the computer (in this case with Microsoft Windows) issue later.

	    <div class="card-text">
	      <p>When you want to install Linux (if you do), there is an &quot;Install Linux&quot; icon on the desktop, that you'd click to start the process.</p>
	      <p>Many Linux live versions, even has Gparted by default to setup your partitions <em>(I am working on a section explaining partitions)</em> before you start the process. Although most distrobutions have a friendly interface to setup partitions and do what needs to be done... (I like setting them up with Gparted first.... just my preference.)</p>
