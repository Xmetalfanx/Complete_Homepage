	<h2>“OK, you have me curious, but I do not want to do anything to my system just yet”</h2>
	
	<p>A-ha !... This is one of the many places where a “ Live Version ” comes in. You can try Linux and see how you like it before you commit to anything.  IN FACT, I recommend playing with a distro for awhile and seeing if you like it before you do anything to your system. </p>
	
	<p>In fact, in many distributions <em>(don't worry if you do not know what this is, yet ... I am getting to answering that)</em>, running the Live Version is a good way to see if it supports your hardware.</p>
	
	<p>If everything plays <em>( say your graphics card plays videos and your favorite Mp3s play)</em> , then those same things will be fine when you INSTALL the distro in question.</p>
	
	
	<h2>Another way Linux (installed or not) can be VERY helpful</h2>
	
	<p>I want to bring up the fact that even if you install Linux but don't use it much..(though a live version works here too) … Linux is a GREAT way to get to your data if Windows has a “meltdown”. Some users are surprised ALL of their data is still there, even when Windows will not even boot into “safe mode”.</p>
	
	<p>This can be <em>(example your in a rush and have to get to a report or other document on your hard drive, &quot;RIGHT NOW&quot;)</em> … you can “instantly get” to your data and then trouble the computer (in this case with Microsoft Windows) issue later.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Deciding you want to install</h3>
	
	<p>When you want to install Linux (if you do), there is an &quot;Install Linux&quot; icon on the desktop, that you'd click to start the process.</p>
	<p>Many Linux live versions, even has Gparted by default to setup your partitions <em>(I am working on a section explaining partitions)</em> before you start the process. Although most distrobutions have a friendly interface to setup partitions and do what needs to be done... (I like setting them up with Gparted first.... just my preference.)</p>
