  <p class="boldUnderline">I am  worried about being confused by &ldquo;new&rdquo; software I am not familiar  with.  </p>
  <p> Before I even begin, I will say some new users are under the  impression that they will have to re-learn basic tasks, such as  copying, pasting, saving a file, just to name a few &hellip; that is NOT  THE CASE.   These tasks (while you may be doing them in a different  program than what your use to),  are the same in Windows and Linux.  </p>
  <p>First I want to say that other than an  unfamiliar name for a program, the functioning of many programs (say  play, stop, &ldquo;next track&rdquo; ..etc in video or audio players) are no  different from Microsoft Windows programs for the same task&hellip; its just the name of the program you'd use that changes  </p>
  <p>Now, I have to say that many of the  (opinion here) best Windows program for a particular task, are cross  platform, so that means you can find &ldquo;familiar faces&rdquo; in Linux  that you have used in Windows for years.  </p>
