      p A-ha !... This is one of the many places where a “ Live Version ” comes in. You can try Linux and see how you like it before you commit to anything.  IN FACT, I'd recommend playing with a distro for awhile and seeing if you like it before you do anything to your system.

      p  In many distributions 
        span.font-italics (see my "Common Terms" page if this confuses you)
        | , running the "Live Version" is a good way to see if it supports your hardware.

        p If everything 'plays nice' ( say your graphics card plays videos and your favorite Mp3s play) , then those same things will be fine when you INSTALL the distro in question, to your hard-drive.
          p NOTE that if certain video files do not play ..that could be a codec issue (I dont want to get into that here) and it may still be playable later on ...

    h2.card-title Another way Linux (installed or not) can be VERY helpful
    .card-text
      p I want to bring up the fact that even if you install Linux but don't use it much..(though a live version works here too) … Linux is a GREAT way to get to your data if Windows has a “meltdown”. Some users are surprised ALL of their data is still there, even when Windows will not even boot into “safe mode”.

      p This can be 
        .font-weight-italics (example your in a rush and have to get to a report or other document on your hard drive, &quot;RIGHT NOW&quot;)
        | … you can “instantly get” to your data and then trouble the computer (in this case with Microsoft Windows) issue later.

    h2.card-title Deciding you want to install
    .card-text
      p When you want to install Linux (if you do), there is an &quot;Install Linux&quot; icon on the desktop, that you'd click to start the process.

      p Many Linux live versions, even has Gparted by default to setup your partitions <em>(I am working on a section explaining partitions)</em> before you start the process. Although most distrobutions have a friendly interface to setup partitions and do what needs to be done... (I like setting them up with Gparted first.... just my preference.)
