##What on earth is this "Desktop Environment"?.. I had a hard enough time with "Distros-vs-versions...etc etc "


There is a reason I left this for later *(to not over-confuse people )*.

The Desktop Environment, or *"D.E."*, as some people call it, is the graphical way a user interacts (trust me that sounds more complicated then it really is) with their operating system. 

- The Desktop Environment, is like the start menu, context (right-click on the mouse) menu and much more in (Microsoft) Windows


####Windows (Example)
- In Windows there is only one Desktop "Environment".   
	- NOTE WHAT i AM ABOUT TO SAY IS JUST A METAPHOR AND NOT TWO DIFFERENT "Desktops" ... 
		- You can think of Windows 95-era to say Windows 7-era (start menu, right click on desktop, taskbar ...etc) as one DE 
		- The Metro/"Tile" interface would be another
	- (Again PLEASE there are NOT two different DE's in Windows ... I was just using that as a metaphor for someone use to MS Windows)

####Linux 
In Linux, like many other aspects, you have multiple options, based on what one you like best and which works best with your hardware

IF your happy with the one that came with the Linux distribution, GREAT... if not... you can choose to try a different DE or you can try another DE just to see what it is like.  

You do not even ***"have to"***, remove a Desktop Environment, to try another option, if you do not want to.... IF you like the "new" DE better and DO WANT TO REMOVE the first one you were using, you can .. Its all up to you, not some company.

Please see my Desktop/Windows Manager Section to see examples and options for  what different Desktops are like.
