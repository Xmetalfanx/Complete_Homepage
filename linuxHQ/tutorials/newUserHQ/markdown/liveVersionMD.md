##“OK, you have me curious, but I do not want to do anything to my system just yet”

A-ha !... This is one of the many places where a “ Live Version ” comes in. You can try Linux and see how you like it before you commit to anything.  Personally, I recommend playing with a distro for awhile and seeing if you like it before you do anything to your system. 

In fact, in many distributions *(don't worry if you do not know what this is, yet ... I am getting to answering that)*, running the Live Version is a good way to see if it supports your hardware.

If everything plays *( say your graphics card plays videos and your favorite Mp3s play)* , then those same things will be fine when you INSTALL the distro in question.


##Another way Linux (installed or not) can be VERY helpful

I want to bring up the fact that even if you install Linux but don't use it much..(though a live version works here too) … Linux is a GREAT way to get to your data if Windows has a “meltdown”. 

- Some users are surprised ALL of their data is still there, even when Windows will not even boot into “safe mode”.

 
This can be *(example-  your in a rush and have to get to a report or other document on your hard drive, "RIGHT NOW")* … you can “instantly get” to your data and then trouble the computer (in this case with Microsoft Windows) issue later.

### Deciding you want to install 
When you want to install Linux (if you do), there is an "Install Linux" icon on the desktop, that you'd click to start the process.

Many Linux live versions, even has Gparted by default to setup your partitions *(I am working on a section explaining partitions)* before you start the process. Although most distributions have a friendly interface to setup partitions and do what needs to be done... (I like setting them up with Gparted first.... just my preference.)
