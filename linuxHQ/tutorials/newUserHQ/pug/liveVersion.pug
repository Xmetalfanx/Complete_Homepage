      p A-ha !... This is one of the many places where a “Live Version ” comes in. You can try Linux and see how you like it before you commit to anything.  IN FACT, I'd recommend experiencing a distro in live mode, for awhile and seeing if you like it before you do anything to your system.

      p I want to bring up the fact that even if you install Linux but don't use it much..(though a live version works here too) … Linux is a GREAT way to get to your data if Windows has a “meltdown”. Some users are surprised ALL of their data is still there, even when Windows will not even boot into “safe mode”.

      p When you want to install Linux (if you do), there is an &quot;Install Linux&quot; icon on the desktop, that you'd click to start the process.

      p Many Linux live versions, even has Gparted by default to setup your partitions <em>(I am working on a section explaining partitions)</em> before you start the process. Although most distrobutions have a friendly interface to setup partitions and do what needs to be done... (I like setting them up with Gparted first.... just my preference.)
