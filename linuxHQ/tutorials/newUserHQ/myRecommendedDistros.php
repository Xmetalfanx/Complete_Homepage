		  <p>*** THESE ARE ALL BASED ON MY OPINIONS ... ** </p>
		  <p> I WANT TO BE CLEAR TO SEPERATE &quot;FACT&quot; PARTS OF THIS SITE WITH MY OPINIONS </p>
		  <p><strong>Which  Distribution do you recommend?</strong>. </p>


		  <p>
			  I would NOT USE any &ldquo;fake Linux&rdquo;  (say installing Linux INSIDE of Windows, which takes away the point of
			  Linux in the first place).  I am not saying you need to try all of  these, though in order (from top being the most
			  recommended) on down,  I thought I'd name a few choices I like or recommend for beginners
		  </p>

		  <p>(insert graphics and links here)
		  </p>
		  <p>
			<BR>1)
			<img src="../graphics/icons/mint.png" width="90" height="90"  alt=""/>
			<span class="boldUnderline">Linux Mint
			</span> &ndash; This is  basically the same as Ubuntu with a few additions such as codecs used  for Mp3s and Video files
			ALREADY installed &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo;....  Ubuntu is the same, though you have to (just using the codec thing as
			an example) install them if you want to play videos or music, right  after you bootup for the first time.
		  </p>

		  <p>Technically: Linux Mint is a branch  (think of a tree) of Ubuntu with it's own team of developers though (despite
		  what some Ubuntu fans say) many of the &ldquo;under the hood&rdquo;  (automotive metaphor) stuff is the same.. .
		  some people will get picky  about helping (say if you admit you are on Linux Mint, in an Ubuntu  chat room) &hellip;
		  This (on many levels) doesn't make any sense to me  since many of the issues are common to both Mint and Ubuntu (for
		  example).
		  </p>

		  <p> The numbers of both &ldquo;dont line up&rdquo;  with each other, though the rough release-dates do.
		  For Instance  Linux Mint 16 (November 2013 release) is based in part on Ubuntu  13.10 (October 2013 release)

			<span class="boldUnderline">
			  <img src="../graphics/icons/lite.png" width="90" height="90"  alt=""/>Linux Lite -
			</span>
		  </p>
		  <p>BOTH OF THESE have Live Versions and as  I stated earlier .. .
		  You'd boot into the Live Version and click the  &ldquo;install&rdquo; icon to install it, if you wanted to do so.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			<span class="bold">Branch-name  confusion in  &ldquo; *buntu Distrobutions&rdquo;
			</span>
		  </p>
		  <p>Basically the branch names = the default DE's first( usually two or three letters) + Ubuntu
		  </p>
		  <UL>
			<LI>
			<p>
			  <em>(in all of these cases, you can  	install any and all of the other DE's, the default one is just the
			  one that boots up if you don't download any of the others)
			  </em>
			</p>
			<LI>
			<p>
			  <em>Examples
			  </em>
			</p>
			<LI>      Kubuntu = the  	KDE DE + &ldquo;buntu&rdquo;
			<LI>      Lubuntu = LDXE  	DE + &ldquo;buntu&rdquo;
			<LI>      Xubuntu = XFCE  	DE + &ldquo;buntu&rdquo;
			<LI>      Edubuntu =  	(not really sure what DE) + Educational packages that are not in  	Ubuntu by default
			<LI>      (See a  	pattern?)
		  </UL> <BR />
		  <p>Some people get  tripped up with this sometimes and its not really a big deal.
		  </p>
		  <p>  * Linux Mint (my  current favorite) does not do all this name confusion stuff.  Linux  mint is just &ldquo;Linux Mint
		   &hellip; with KDE&rdquo;  or &ldquo;Linux Mint with  XFCE&rdquo; &hellip;. same thing as Ubuntu though they don't change
		   the name  (ex &ndash; Xubuntu) &hellip; to be this can help AVOID new users getting  tripped up &ldquo;Up to their
		   eyeballs&rdquo; in choices of Linux, when they are use to Windows.
