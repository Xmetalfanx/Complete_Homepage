	$content = <<<EOD

		<p><em>THESE ARE ALL BASED ON MY OPINIONS</em></p>
		<p>I WANT TO BE CLEAR TO SEPARATE &quot;FACT&quot; PARTS OF THIS SITE WITH MY OPINIONS</p>
		<h2>Which distribution do you recommend?</h2>
		<p>I would NOT USE any “fake Linux” (say installing Linux INSIDE of Windows, which takes away the point of Linux in the first place). I am not saying you need to try all of these, though in order (from top being the most recommended) on down, I thought I'd name a few choices I like or recommend for beginners</p>
		<p>(insert graphics and links here)</p>
		<ol>
		<li>
		<p><img src="/linuxHQ/graphics/icons/mint.png" alt="Linux Mint Icon" /> <strong>Linux Mint</strong> – This is basically the same as Ubuntu with a few additions such as codecs used for Mp3s and Video files ALREADY installed “out of the box”.... Ubuntu is the same, though you have to (just using the codec thing as an example) install them if you want to play videos or music, right after you boot-up for the first time.</p>
		<p>Technically: Linux Mint is a branch (think of a tree) of Ubuntu with it's own team of developers though (despite what some Ubuntu fans say) many of the “under the hood” (automotive metaphor) stuff is the same.. . some people will get picky about helping (say if you admit you are on Linux Mint, in an Ubuntu chat room) … This (on many levels) doesn't make any sense to me since many of the issues are common to both Mint and Ubuntu (for example).</p>
		<p>The numbers of both “dont line up” with each other, though the rough release-dates do. For Instance Linux Mint 16 (November 2013 release) is based in part on Ubuntu 13.10 (October 2013 release)</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><img src="/linuxHQ/graphics/icons/lite.png" alt="Linux Lite Icon" /> Linux Lite -</p>
		<p>BOTH OF THESE have Live Versions and as I stated earlier .. . You'd boot into the Live Version and click the “install” icon to install it, if you wanted to do so.</p>
		</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Branch-name confusion in “ *buntu Distributions”</h3>
		<p>Basically the branch names = the default DE's first( usually two or three letters) + Ubuntu</p>
		<p>(in all of these cases, you can install any and all of the other DE's, the default one is just the one that boots up if you don't download any of the others)</p>
		<p><em>Examples</em></p>
		<pre><code>Kubuntu = the KDE DE + “buntu”
		Lubuntu = LDXE DE + “buntu”
		Xubuntu = XFCE DE + “buntu”
		Edubuntu = (not really sure what DE) + Educational packages that are not in Ubuntu by default
		(See a pattern?)
		</code></pre>

		<p>Some people get tripped up with this sometimes and its not really a big deal.</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Linux Mint (my current favorite) does not do all this name confusion stuff. Linux mint is just “Linux Mint … with KDE” or “Linux Mint with XFCE” …. same thing as Ubuntu though they don't change the name (ex – Xubuntu) … to be this can help AVOID new users getting tripped up “Up to their eyeballs” in choices of Linux, when they are use to Windows.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>**(summary: Think of having a number of different ways to interact via the Interface.... not just where on the screen the start menu is, or the color of the menu, but how everything looks and operates … don't worry .. there is not that big of a difference and its not confusing once you have it in front of you )</p>
