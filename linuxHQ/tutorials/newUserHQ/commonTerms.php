  <UL>
    <LI>* I have decided to leave  		&ldquo;Desktop environments  		until later... I don't want to overload people and confuse them  		here... just so you know, I will cover this later... I am trying to  		do these guides as simple as possible, WHILE trying to have as much  		information as I can in them)
    <li>A common place for new users to  	get tripped up is with all of these terms.</li>
    </UL>
			  <p class="boldUnderline">Summary</p>
			  <p>Microsoft is the only company that  	makes &ldquo;Windows&rdquo;, while many companies/individual developers and coders, make their own &ldquo;flavored&rdquo;  	versions of Linux </p>
			  <p>OK NOW...  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A <span class="terms">distribution</span> is the big difference from &ldquo;this&rdquo;  	Linux to &ldquo;that Linux&rdquo;.... .</li>

		<li>
      <p>A <span class="terms">version</span> <span class="italics">(tied with code names in many cases)</span>
      <span class="italicsUnderline">number</span>
      is just a  version of that distribution of Linux &hellip; in the Microsoft world its like &ldquo;Windows 98 vs Windows XP -vs- Windows 8...etc &rdquo;</p>

		  <p>The codename is nothing to be  concerned with.  Its like a person's nickname.  &
      hellip; like &ldquo;Linux  Mint 10 Smiling Squirrel&rdquo; (the code name I just made up there)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Linux Mint 10 = Version </li>
        <li>&ldquo;Smiling Squirrel&rdquo; = codename.... no big deal
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="boldUnderline">Metaphor </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>The <span class="terms">Distribution</span> is a Family	Name (last name)</li>
	    <li>The <span class="terms">Versions</span>. are different  people in that family with the same last name.</li>
	    <li>The <span class="terms">code name </span>are like nicknames  for particular PEOPLE in the family &hellip; &ldquo;tied&rdquo; to the version  			(numbers)</li>
	  </ul>
