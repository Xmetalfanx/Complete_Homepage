  <p class="boldUnderline">&ldquo;What  on earth is this &ldquo;Desktop Environment&rdquo;?..  I had a hard enough time with &ldquo;Distros-vs-versions...etc etc &rdquo; &quot;</p>
  <p>There is a reason I left this for later  (<span class="italics">to not over-confuse people )</span>.  </p>
  <p>The <span class="terms">Desktop Environment</span>, <span class="italics">or &quot;D.E.&quot;, as some people  call it</span>, is like the start menu, context (right-click on the mouse)  menu and much more in Windows &hellip; it controls HOW you interact with  the Operating System. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>In Windows there is only one <span class="italics">(not  counting, Metro in Windows 8</span>) Desktop &quot;Envirnoment&quot; </li>
    <li>In Linux, like many other aspects, you have multiple options, based on what one you like best and which works best with your hardware
      <ul>
        <li>IF your happy with the one that came with  the Linux distribution, GREAT... if not... you can choose to try a different DE or you can try another DE just to see what it is like </li>
        <li>You do not even &ldquo;have to&rdquo; remove a <span class="terms">Desktop Environment</span>, to try another option, if you do not want to.... IF you like the &quot;new&quot; DE better and DO WANT TO REMOVE the first one you tried, you can .. Its all up to you, not some company.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
