		  <p class="boldUnderline">What is Linux?
		  </p>
		  <p>Linux is an Operating System (the  &ldquo;Master Software&rdquo; that runs all the other software on your machine), which I
		  responsible mainly for the way the user interacts with the computer's hardware ... so as far as the computer user and the hardware of
		  the computer go, the Operating System is the &quot;middle-man&quot; thats in between the two.

		  <span class="italics">(Programs you may be thinking of right now, RUN ON an Operating System) </span>
		  </p>

		  <p>Microsoft Windows, no matter which version, and Apple's  Mac OS's are known to many people  &hellip; though some people
		  overlook Linux as a  	100% FREE  alternative to Microsoft or Apple Operating Systems. </p>

		  <p class="boldUnderline">Personal Comments </p>
		  <p>*** SOME THINGS SUCH AS WHAT I HOPE TO DESCRIBE ON PAGES IN THIS SECTION MAY BE VERY CONFUSING TO A NEW USER...
		  The point I want to make is that everyone (including myself) was new to Linux at one point, and I have YEARS of experience,
		  though I wouldn't ever claim to be an expert. Alot of these things become &quot;second nature&quot; after awhile, and you
		   don't even think about them. Some things (such as &quot;Desktop Envirnoments&quot;, I can describe to until I am blue in the
		   face, though, seeing pictures and ... just getting into each one and playing with them yourself, you will be more comfortable
		   with them once you gain personal experience with them. </p>

		  <p>Reading Manuals, watching video tutorials, and simply PLAYING WITH Linux over the years is how I learned so much myself. </p>
		  <p>&nbsp; </p>
		  <p>By the way, new users may be wondering about the peguin thing ... the Peguin is sort of an offical/Unoffical &quot;mascot&quot;
		  for all Linux distributions </p>
