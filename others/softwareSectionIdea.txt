Idea for software section.

* "else if" is used, there is no "elif" 

in the JS have an if/elif type .... "if localSubCat = ... " and elif "localMainCat= .... "

the thinking is to not have "localsubcat" on pages that aren't specific.... (say a main "graphics apps" page),,, but not have "localMainCat" on the pages that ARE specific 



I need to know the "mainCat" var in the JS file
