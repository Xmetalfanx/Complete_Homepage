          <div>Removed Icon/reference to my old Google+ account which I removed for good earlier tonight ... most people I know on Google+ were going to other platforms anyway, and Google+ is closing for good, soon, so I closed my account down ahead of time</div>

          <div class="font-weight-bold">My Github Other Github project</div><a href="https://github.com/Xmetalfanx/linuxSetup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinuxSetup</a>- Helps a user setup some things with a menu system on Ubuntu, Fedora, OpenSuse, and (minor things for this distro ... so far) Solus.
