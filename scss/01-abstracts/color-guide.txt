- theme-color-l should be the lightest color, in the theme 
  - used for backgrounds, if i recall 
- theme-color-d should be the darkest color in the theme 
  - i think i intended for this to be some variation of dark grey or black 
- theme-color-accent-d
  - unless i searched wrong, I am not seeing this used at all but ... "leave it for now and have it match the theme may be helpful 
- theme-color-accent-l
  - this is for say non-card headers (where theme-color-l is the background) 
  - i need to lookup where else i have this 
- theme-color-main
  - used for things like the header and footer background color
  - ... not sure about say card header backgrounds
