These are a few tips to help you clean your computer of various types of infections.  

I am not saying this is a shore-fire way of getting rid of everything, but it can get rid of most infection related issues.

**BACKUP BACKUP BACKUP!**

Do I really need to type anything here?.... Just remember to backup BEFORE a bad infection hits... this will give you piece of mind that your data can be recovered in the worst cases (say you have to buy a new computer … your data is safely on the backup media) 

*** The next Guide I am most likely going to release is one of backing up and “Drive Imaging” (Think of the CD that came with (or you had to make in my case) computer... 

After you customize the computer the way you want (and then image it and back those images up to somewhere OFF the computer, you can restore your completely customized system. (Baring any major hardware failure on “That” machine) 

I say off the computer, though if your like me and have a 500GB+ harddrive you can leave a copy of the images on the computer too.. or make a “customized restore partition”.  

The point TO MOVING the images off the system is that “if your hard drive WITH the backups fails … what good are the backups going to do?” (not counting if they are on another partition and it's NOT hardware failure as, I just mentioned)

*People giving bad advice*

I am not saying I am perfect, and in fact I will say it … I AM NOT PERFECT.  I try to help people with great products and if I can .. FREE products to save people money.  Whether Bots (program that post answers, “acting like” real responses, or just people who want to give people asking for help grief, I have seen a few things that have annoyed me

- Asker: “I have an infection... what is the best way to remove it?”

	- Bad Answer #1: “Just reformat everything” or “Restore to system default”


I am not saying “never reformat”, though if you have tried the all the usual methods of infection removal.  Just do not "freak out" because you think/or do have a virus.   Sometimes losing EVERYTHING is complete overkill of a solution.

***Reason I feel this is bad advice:***
Well of course I will not say “DO NOT REFORMAT, EVER”, and every case is different.

I have to remind the user of a key fact... Just because you do not know how to remove the infection without reformatting (which still may not remove it), doesn't mean it can not be done.

I AM NOT knocking users who do not know how to remove infections … of course, the point to this whole guide is to inform and educate people.  As I said in one of my other guides … “Messing stuff up” is part of the way I learned what I know.... just remember the “Backup” points I mentioned earlier in this guide

SOMETIMES a reformat/re-imaging (restoring from a backup image)  IS NEEDED or even is the quicker solution, though the people who suggest this first are wrong to do so … all it does is make the user with machine is infected lose all of their data and then they may have more issues “Restoring the computer” then removing the infection in the first place

- Bad Answer #2: “Dump Windows … it's junk... Install Linux”

***Reason I feel this is bad advice:***

I am not going to bore people in this guide saying how much I love Linux.  It's a great product, and I could make several pages for devoted to Linux alone, but for new users, SWITCHING OPERATING SYSTEMS is not the smart thing to suggest.  If you remove the infection (the infected users) and then want to give Linux a try, GO AHEAD, …. It just will not help.  

   If anything, for new users, this will just confuse them more.

####Safe Mode Needed
Some of these scanners (to fully get rid of infections) have to be ran in Safe Mode. 
To boot into Safe Mode 

1. Before the Windows “Welcome Logo”, press F8 and in the menu that now appears, 

2. Hit one of the “boot into safe mode” options.
Just “Safe Mode” is perfectly fine
Getting these tools from another machine, if needed

---
###Possible Boot Media Needed
You may have to download these products on other computer and then transfer them to the infected computer (via USB Flash Drive, External HDD, CD or DVD, LAN, ...etc ) in order to use them.

Another option is to get some of the tools below on a bootable CD/DVD in case you cant get into your system. One of my favorites is UBCD 4 Windows ( http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/Boot-Manager-Disk/UBCD4WIN.shtml )

####Help with common fake anti-viruses and/or fake malware/spyware infections

If you have been infected with one of the fake anti-virus/malware scanners: http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/virus-removal/ is a great resource on how to remove them automatically and manually. There are more specific tools for each specific infection and they have helped MANY users.

Typically if you cant find the name of an antivirus that is one way to tell it's a fake. “Antivirus 2010” or “System Security 2012” without any “Company name” in front of it is a give-away to be a fake.

There are so fake versions of known scanners that make you think they are the legit program

Here are some links to fake scanner removals
The “Antivirus”/”System Security” Series – 
These I believe are typically the same, though they have been updated over the years and the # (the year number I mean) changes

    An infection that fakes being, one of my favorite scanners, Eset NOD32.  As long you get Eset from a trust source such as Softpedia.com, Download.com , or Eset's homepage, of course, you will be safe, and there is NOTHING to worry about “Is this the real Eset?”-wise
    The Common Redirect infection that redirects almost all web-site requests .. known as the “Google Redirect” Infection.  If you have an infection that keeps redirecting all websites you try to go to, you probably have this infection.

**Message about Free products**
PLEASE do not let people talk you into "you get what you pay for", and all free programs are not any good.  Not to say “All PAID programs are no good”, many of my personal favorite scanners are free. .. with the few exceptions, most of my favorite and security site "best programs" are free.  It SHOULD BE NOTED THAT not all Free scanners are good, the same with paid scanners … just because a scanner cost more, doesn't make it better.


####Common Differences between free and paid versions
Better tech support from company(although I had questions for Comodo AND Avast, and (via forum) both responded promptly, and answered my question(s) completely)

The detection rate of freewares (like Avast and Avira) are 100% the same, as their pro versions.  THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE.

This may change from version (say from AV 2005 to AV 2010) I mean comparing “AV 2010” to “AV 2010 Pro edition” Paid Programs tend to bundle AV's + Parental Control Software + Firewalls + “Spam blockers” together … I find that using a different program for both suites my taste more. If you need an “all in one” program, perhaps a paid version of one of the recommended products, WOULD be best for you

##Anti-viruses
Antiviruses protect your system from viruses and SOME malware attacts.  Unfortunately, not all anti-viruses are “created equal”. 
The way I “Rate” Virus scanners
There are no “perfect” virus scanners and they all have false alarms and no matter how small the rate, they all let some infection through (I am talking less then 1% to 2% of all infections) by.  DO NOT GET ME WRONG, I am not saying “they all stink”.....It is not impossible, though its rare to get that 1% of viruses that even the best scanners let by.

I “rate” scanners based on TRUSTED review sites, and regrettably, not all sites that review security related programs, are good.  I do have to note, that I do not do comprehensive testing, or anything of that nature, but rather I base my opinions on several factors
TRUSTED review/security program testing sites (as previously stated)
Personal experience, USING these products
Personal experience, seeing other people use these products and taking into account the good and the bad experiences, that they have with it


###ANTI-VIRUSES ARE NOT MALWARE SCANNERS
While good  antivirus software can detect malware, there are separate programs (I will get to them later in the guide... Malwarebytes and Super Anti-spyware) for Malware that are “made for malware” and 100% free. 

Which Anti-virus scanners do I recommend or NOT recommend?
Trusted Free Products
Both of these top two scanners have similar (Great) detection rates and are “neck and neck” as the best Free anti-virus if you ask me.  NOTE: ALL Anti-viruses FREE and Pro have some number of false alarms, so I will not include this in any “cons”



- Avast – FREE - ( http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download )
Pros:  
Boot Scan, Constantly having good Detection, Email Scanning. IM Scanning, P2P (File Sharing) scanning for many common programs
(To go off the former “Con” below) … version 6 and above have been doing better on my older computer, which it use to lock the the computer to the point it was un- responsive. … They really have improved the memory usage, if you ask me
Cons: 
This is no longer a con for me on my older XP laptop. However, version 5 and below use to free my older computer 
(1.79GHz single core, 768MB of RAM... just to give those reading this, a “point of reference”)
 OR 




- Avira – FREE - ( http://www.avira.com/en/avira-free-antivirus ) 

Pro: 
Top-notch Detection rate, compatible to any “paid” anti-virus software
Cons: 
The versions I have tried since 11 and after have been getting “bloated” if you ask me … do not get me wrong, a lot of other scanners are a lot worse.  Just it seems on my older systems as Avast has gotten better “system resource-wise”, Avira is still good with resources, though it has been doing odd stuff such as “ updating even when I tell it not to and have “auto-update” turned off. 
Displays ad to buy the pro version when updating the free scanner.  This is not a big deal as you just click “OK” to close the “ad window” and that's it.  Some people make this out to be more of an “ordeal” that it really is.

Not so Good Free Products


As far as Microsoft Security Essentials is concerned ... 
http://preview.tinyurl.com/3ednu7g  and http://preview.tinyurl.com/62prw64  are two links from resources, I have trusted (Langa, for years) that prove MSE have issues with viruses and Malware infections, that some other 




AVG from my experience with helping users, is even worse than Microsoft Security Essentials
If you have to use Microsoft Security Essentials or AVG (I'd advise neither one), Microsoft Security Essentials is the better option

Trusted Paid Programs
First I want to say that Avira and Avast both offer paid versions of their products and that they should be considered 




Eset's NOD32 Anti-virus , which provides great protection and no system lag.  It has ranked near the top of the anti-virus market for years.  I love this option, though I do not use it on my personal machines (I choice the free options), I highly recommend Eset's Anti-virus


Kaspersky is my #4 pick, it  is not as good as it use to be, I have to say that this is not an “insult” to Kaspersky I had loved it as my only AV recommendation from about 2000-2009. Since it is not terrible, since it dropped down my list, I still in a way feel loyal to Kaspersky .. It is still  A GREAT choice and it had been my anti-virus protection of choice for years, as I have said 



Online/ “Cloud” Antivirus Scanners

http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner is Eset's Online Scanner which is free to use, though it should be noted that most Anti-virus companies offer online scanners now... Kaspersky and other AV developers, offer their own free online scanner

###Malware/Spyware related
Do not confuse these products with anti-viruses.   

While some Anti-viruses are decent at detecting and removing SOME malware, my advice would be to have both types of scanners on your system.  

####Comments on Free malware scanners listed here
Some say "they will not protect you" … that is SIMPLY NOT TRUE. The two best, if you ask me are 100% free (though the companies offer “pro” versions for those that desire the added features.

####Differences between the Free and Paid Versions of these products
The main thing that the free versions of the two listed programs (below) 

There is no "background" scanner running all the time in free versions; however, Use common sense on the web … Do not just download “anything and everything”. Or illegal (THIS IS FOR VARIOUS REASONS OF COURSE) products

This is not a knock on legit download portals such as “Softpedia”, or “FileHippo”.  If you download software from there, it is infection free and legit .. though too much of any software can tend to “clog up” systems
Run “Quick” or “Full” scans from time to time ("just to be safe, and check your system") 
ANY detected items CAN and WILL BE (with user's permission, of course) removed.
 I have seen a lot of people say “to actually remove any infection you have to buy one of these programs.  Though IF you are going to purchase a product, I would suggest the paid versions of the two freewares, I list, you do not really need to spend any money to get protected.
The only two scanners I recommend 
Both of these are free and have excellent records at removing malware/spyware infections... they really are the two best best options.  I would NOT recommend them if they were Free and “no so good” at detection and removal.  I help people for “fun” and to give a hand to those that need it, though I have to say most tech's I talk to actually use these programs to remove infections on customer computers.  

(Note: for hard to remove infection other tools may need to be ran first … check out the other sections later in this guide for more information on those added tools). All this means is you may need to run at least one of those programs, THEN (example) MalwareBytes for complete removal of your infection.  

AFTER you “remove” the infection, (I recommend this with Malware AND viruses infections … I would run a full system scan again, “just to double check”) 



- MalwareBytes ( http://www.malwarebytes.org/ ) and 



Super AntiSpyware ( http://www.superantispyware.com/ ) 

###For Badly infected Computers
Additional software needed


- ComboFix ( http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/combofix/how-to-use-combofix )
I have seen ComboFix, first-hand help computers that were badly infected; new users, should only use this if reformatting SEEMS like the only hope, after MalwareBytes “fails”.

    I have to say that this falls into one of those categories of “If you really are not comfortable, AND do not know what your doing” … I wouldn't use this, or … I would download it to the infected machine and let a tech (who would likely use these programs anyway) 

    I had seen a computer that wouldn't even boot to safe mode get fixed, first-hand, using ComboFix and it didn't even take too long either.

    Note: Like TDSKiller from Kaspersky (listed below), ComboFix is being updated a lot and not counting the homepage for either application, you can check out the Majorgeeks.com homepage and you will see new versions being released

    For badly infected computers here are a few more options:
    What if Malwarebytes (or SuperAntispyware) fails by itself?
    Some options for some infections that block security software like Malwarebytes and your AV from removing them, by disabling the infections “blocking” feature are (called “Rootkits”) :



- RKill ( http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/anti-virus/rkill )

	A common fix for some infections is as follows (I am not saying it will work for you, but it's worth a shot)

    1. Reboot to Safe Mode
    2. Run RKill (remember to get RKill from a legit site)
    3. DO NOT REBOOT ... still in safe mode, NOW run Malwarebytes
    4. Reboot and (just a tip: run a full AV and Spyware scan "just to be double-sure your infection free") and test programs and the stuff you normally use to see if everything is back to normal


##Rootkits

I have to do more research on Rootkits before I can claim to know a lot about them, though I have to say I am pretty sure these are the “infections” or parts of infections that typically prevent Malware scanners and Anti-virus Scanners from working properly (it blocks these programs from removing the infection)

There is one program that can take care of the root-kit portion that comes to mind

- Kaspersky's TDSSKiler 



http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/virus-removal/remove-tdss-tdl3-alureon-rootkit-using-tdsskiller 

This has been posted as a solution to many Rootkit issues and along with being developed by one of the best security companies on the market, TDSSKiller (This goes for Rkill and ComboFix as well, for that matter) is always being updated


I do not take credit for the BleepingComputers.com description below.
        [BleepingComputers]

        Summary:
        A Rootkit is a program that attempts to hide itself, other files, or computer data so that they cannot be seen on the computer.

        Detailed description:
        RootRepeal and GMER, which contain a graphical user interface that quickly allows you to scan your computer for potential rootkits. When using these programs, though, you need to make sure you interpret the results properly as false positives are common.
        Though the vast majority of rookits are used for criminal purposes, rootkits have been used for what may be considered more legitimate reasons. 
        Today rootkit technology is used within legitimate programs such as Alcohol 120% and Daemon tools in order to hide themselves from being seen by anti-piracy programs. Some anti-virus programs also use aspects of rootkit technology in order to protect your computers from viruses.
        [/BleepingComputers Text]

One reason rootkits can be found is poor (I am going by what others say) programming.  Rootkits are suppose to be undetectable; though, with the way they are apparently coded, they … well aren't un-detectable

The rootkit scanners that you may find scan for common activity related to rootkits, called “intercept instructions” that may be (key: MAY be) a sign of a rootkit.   

I admit I am no expert on the subject, so if you are interested, please research rootkits, yourself


#Credits
I take credit only  for my opinions and reviews of these products.

All icons and programs, belong to their respected companies, or developers.  I do release these guides are constantly “under construction” and I have no goal in copying anyone's else's work (WITHOUT GIVING THEM full credit for it).  I just want to help people by consolidating many bits of information into an easy to use and navigate guide.

I know people may download these, who know a lot more then I do on some of these subjects, and do have to mention, I am NOT AN “EXPERT”.  These guides are geared toward newer users or users who have used computers for years that are just curious how to fix/tweak/optimize their computer.  

These guides are not suppose to be technical guides but more for those that want to know how to fix/optimize/secure their devices, “In Plain English”
