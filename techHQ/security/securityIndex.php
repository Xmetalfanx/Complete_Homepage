    and recommend and which one I&#39;d avoid)</p>

    <strong>Late October 2010 Message:</strong> I have read alot of &quot;the internet is out to get you!&quot; type posts and
    articles in magazines.</p>

	  <p>If you don not know what your doing, and do not take a few simple steps, you can really have a mess on your computer;
    however, in a way... I think some of these things are blown out of proportion to be honest, You DO NEED to secure yourself
    online; however, it seems alot of these articles are trying to push security programs, where if you pay attention closely, you
    will see the companies that have the &quot;best ratings&quot; actually pay to have advertisements placed in that magazine</p>
    <p>I am NOT going to &quot;name names&quot; (Magazines OR Security products), but I will say ... read real life users reviews,
    and go on what your experiences are</p>

	<p>Remember</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Just because your anti-virus or malware scanner says you :
      <ul>
        <li>&quot;Are infected&quot; does not make it true, if it is a poor scanner</li>
        <li>&quot;Are not infected&quot; does not mean you are not, again ... if its a poor scanner</li>
      </ul></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Overall Security Tips</h2>
    <h3>COMMON SENSE.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If you do not know who someone is, would you let them in your home?.. NO .. .... using the same logic, ... If you do not
      know an e-mail address, do not open the attachment.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Use a good Anti-virus</h3>
    <p>
    <img src="/techHQ/bork/swedish_chef1.jpg" alt="Swedish Chef from the Muppets" /> I have heard some techs tell new users not to
    use any anti-virus and to reformat when things get slightly &quot;borked (Muppet Swedish Chef joke) ...</p>
    <p>Anyways, DON NOT LISTEN TO THEM ... Simply using a FREE anti-virus like Avira or Avast, which both get great reviews even
    compared to paid anti-viruses, and use common sense and you will be just fine. IT IS TO BE NOTED that not all free scanners are
    good scanners. AVG and Microsoft Security Essentials fall into this category... while one is better than the other, .... Both
    fall short in comparison to Avast and Avira.</p>
    <p>Two non-free Anti-viruses I recommend as well are Kaspersky and Eset&#39;s NOD32. They have been getting high marks and have
    been getting them consistently. I do have to note two more &quot;honorable mentions&quot; with Bit Defender and GData (which I
    have never really heard of until reading a few articles). They seem to get really high marks too</p>
    <p>*Resources : *</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Good sources of (just some of them) Anti-virus reviews:
      <ul>
        <li>http://www.av-test.org/en/tests/home-user/windows-7/novdec-2012/</li>
        <li>http://chart.av-comparatives.org/chart2.php</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>Site saying how MS Security Essentials is not very good and one of the worst free scanners out there:
      <ul>
        <li>http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/30/microsoft
        <em>security</em>essentials
        <em>loses</em>avtestcertification/</li>
      </ul></li>
    </ul>

	<h3>Use a Good Malware Scanner</h3>

	<ul>
      <li>MalwareBytes And Super AntiSpyware</li>
      <li>Are the two best scanners and
      <ul>
        <li>They are 100% FREE, though there paid versions of each program</li>
        <li>Pair BOTH of these with Eset Antivirus, Avira, or Avast (and I am sure some others like Kaspersky as well) and you will
        not run into any issue
        <ul>
          <li>The PAID versions of these two program paired with those antivirus MAY cause problems due to the malware scanners
          Real time scanning, running at all times, effecting the Antiviruses real time scanning.</li>
        </ul>
		</li>
      </ul>
	 </li>
    </ul>
