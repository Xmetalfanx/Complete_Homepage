        <p class="boldText">Pro's:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Decent GUI (Interface); although its not the best I have seen.
          </li>
          <li>
          <a href="#note">*</a>Apparently good at getting recent types of exploits (OR SO THEY SAY)
          </li>
          <li>CONSTANTLY BEING UPDATED so if you've used software firewall before and tried and older version of this program... try the new one and you may note that &quot;feature I wanted that wasn't in COMODO&quot; is ... now &quot;IN&quot;
          <ul>
            <li>(I had tried 2.x for example .. and when I tried 3.x .. a few items were now in the new version that was not in 2.x) ... REMEMBER THOUGH .. THIS IS A FREEWARE, SO ... all the features you find in your favorite shareware firewall MAY not be in this program (... or they may be one day .. .you never know)
            </li>
          </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="boldText">Cons:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>I see this becoming the &quot;new&quot; ZoneAlarm. for those that want a good freeware firewall, (but like me) have felt that ZA has become too bloated and large for their taste. Having said that ... alot of &quot;hackers' (or even &quot;script kiddies&quot;) may try to target this firewall and find ways around it more. (of course that's probably happening to all software firewalls anyway)
          </li>
          <li>(Don't take this the wrong way... I am not saying this doesn't provide protection) This Firewall (the freeware .. I am not sure if there is a Pro version at the moment) does not have the advanced features some other firewalls have. I must note these advance features or options that I like are on NON-FREEWARE firewalls,

          <li>Virus Bulletin said it failed the recent ITW test because it missed one of the viruses .. one is not bad but they still list it as a failure .. .

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>It gets alot of things other Antiviruses miss (while others say &quot;average- above average&quot; detection, this gets alot of &quot;100% of all viruses detected&quot; reviews ... (NOTE CON BELOW FOR THIS ONE
          </li>

        <p class="boldText">Cons
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>I have read that
          <span class="italics">(I still admit its one of the top 3 (with Kaspersky and Bit Defender))
          </span> ... This apparently gets ALOT OF false positives ... more than most others.. So while it detects alot of viruses ... even in my own experiences and not just reviews I have read... it detects alot of legit files too. If you don't know what your doing ... this could lead to program crashes (say you delete an &quot;infected&quot; (but really legit) dll for a program.... be careful when deleting things NOD32 detects.
          </li>
          <li>THE INTERFACE
          <ul>
            <li>2.x -- I understand the GUI, but &quot;newbies&quot; may find it hard to use (or at least find it hard to use for a little bit)
            </li>
            <li>3.x - The GUI has been MUCHHHHHHHHH improved and the &quot;Cons&quot; for the GUI for 2.x DO NOT APPLY if your using version 3.x
            </li>
          </ul>
