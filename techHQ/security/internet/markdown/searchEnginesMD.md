###Introduction

I have known these following alternatives for years, though if you want to read more, please see the Ghack Post on alternatives here (and there are some good tips and feedback on the different search engines).. as always, I give full credit to Ghack's author and the feedback of average users for this information

[Ghack Article on DuckDuckGo with feedback (comments) about the others](http://www.ghacks.net/2012/02/02/why-i-switched-to-the-duck-duck-go-search-engine/?_m=3n.0038.418.mk0ao00iht.f9j)

Note: Though this IS TRUE for almost all search engines... you may have to switch from time to time to get better results...

Even with the privacy issues, I am NOT going to say I am not going to use Google again, but rather I will try to use the others, just to break "the habit" of using Google. I may switch from Google 100%, IF (big IF) Startpage has the same results

- As I say below (apparently) Startpage is IxQuick "privacy enhancements" (never tracking you or your searches) WITH Google's results

##Google tracking and "profiling" users?
Even I do not know the full details at the time I am typing this; however, there has been an uproar over Google admitting to tracking searches and creating a "profile" on users ... Esxpecially, if you search after logging into your Google Account (which also includes Youtube now, IF i am not mistaken), I COULD see this to raise many security red-flags.

I HAVE TO ADMIT RIGHT HERE, THAT GOOGLE IS NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN and probably does do things like this. Bing is Microsoft's Search engine and if you search after logging into Hotmail, I (despite what Microsoft may say) suspect them of it to. I AM NOT picking on Google alone.

Below I hope to list some alternatives to Google and my results using them (along with links to sites of others who do the same "search engine comparison"). PLEASE NOTE, these listed are not the only search engines out there, and I am open to finding new sites and adding to the list. I am always "Open" to new ideas and suggestions that work better.

###Alternatives to Google
- (Same Company)
	- They have alot about how they do not track you or keep track of your ip address+ your searches .
	- I have read a bit more and apparently IxQuick and StartPage are the same company's though the key differences are:
	

![IxQuick Icon](http://xmetal.x10.mx/windowsHQ/graphics/search/ixquick2.jpg)

- ** IxQuick**
	I picked this search engine to replace the Google bar on the bottom of my website here
This may change based on my results of using the searches on a regular basies
As you can see in the feedback on that Ghack Link... sometimes IxQuck has "not the best" results for more complex searches

	- ** Pros:** Good Search Results
No tracking or Profiling of the user

	- **Cons:** Search Result URL's cant be copied and pasted (not counting ".....ixquick.com/metasearch.cgi" which doesn't show others what you were searching for (like if you want to link someone to a search result page

	NOTE: what I say above may be a "part" of how they protect your privacy

![startpage Icon](http://xmetal.x10.mx/windowsHQ/graphics/search/www.startpage_com.gif)

**Startpage**
- This uses Google's search engine apparently. ("But wait .. .isn't the point of this to get "away" from Google?".... yes ... read the next point)
- This uses the same security features (not tracking your IP address, ...etc etc) AS IxQuick does (Same company)
	- If IxQuick doesn't provide great results for me, I may switch the search engine "link" on the bottom of this site, again (From Google to IxQuick to Startpage). Google + no privacy issues (if search results are the same for Google and Startpage) .... well this sounds PERFECT.
- Pros: Supposedly Google results without "tracking"/"Profiling" you. Doesn't track your IP and APPARENTLY independant sources have verified this and continue to do so every so often.

	Same Company as IxQuick (listed below)

- Cons: Search Results not the best, but still decent. Despite what it says, I find Google results to be a bit better then Startpage ... now IxQuick is alot more like Google Results... I am not sure whats going on here to cause that.

![duckDuckGo Icon](http://xmetal.x10.mx/windowsHQ/graphics/search/logo_icon60_v101.png)

- **DuckDuckGo**
    - Not the best results all the time, but very reasonable.
    - Many Love this alternative and I admit, I will give this more of a change to see how it regularly does with the results
    - **Pros:** Good Search Results, Simple GUI
    - **Cons:** Honestly ... none ..so far ...Not counting the "Con" about Ixquick not really being a CON possibly ... I have to say I think I found my "Winner" ... again ... IxQuick is really good and you should check them out too

- Bing
Please note message above about this being Microsoft's search engine;
I do not trust MS "Not tracking/profiling me" anymore than Google. Bing May be great (and it does have decent results), but if your concern is privacy. There is no reason to use Bing instead of Google.... that is just my opinion though
Others

![Mamma Search Engine](http://xmetal.x10.mx/windowsHQ/graphics/search/mamma_icon2.jpg)
- ** Mamma.com**
	- This was the last one I used regulary before Google
	
	- From what I remember this was/is a "search engine", search engine. What I mean is that it used several other search engines and combined the best results, to prevent a user from having to go to multiple search sites. Instead ... you just go to Mamma.com.
	
	- the Look of it, the Interface really slimmed down compared to what it use to be, to resemble some of the other search engines, I just listed... Great to see they did that.

###Bottom Line
I know some will go after me for not saying "Boycott Google"; though, Google is not all that bad.

Some people say it's loaded with Advertised results and not showing what your actually looking for. I have to say I have found that not to be the case. Having said that, I am not claiming Google is "perfect".
