##Spyware/Adware/Malware - All Free (although there ARE pro versions)

- ![Malwarebytes Icon](../progIcons/security/malware/mbam_IDI_MAIN.png)[ Malwarebytes ](http://www.malwarebytes.org)
      
	My New favorite spyware/malware scanner that I have seen work &quot;wonders&quot;, multiple times. I love this program

	I have not had alot of experience with it; however, sites that I trust and people I trust, rate it slightly behind &quot;Malware Bytes&quot; as far as an overall product.  </td>

If you ask me, ANY decent scanner will have the ability to scan for all of these.. not to say they are 100% &quot;perfect&quot; ... also some users (myself included) will use a number of scanners for these (not running in &quot;real time&quot; .. aka the background though) ..
   

Like Antiviruses, numerous scanners running in the background at the same time, MAY conflict with one another. 
      
     
##Non-free Antiviruses          
     

I recommend/think are &quot;good&quot;, but not &quot;Great&quot;        
                        
   
- ![Bit Defender](../progIcons/security/AVs/960__bitDefender2.gif)[ Bit Defender]()

	Use to be in the top 3 (with NOD32 and Kaspersky); however, has falling in some areas, due to bloat-ware being installed with it. 
           
	I have recently seen what looks like a basic (that's a GOOD thing) scanner that MAY BE missing &quot;realtime protection&quot; (background scanning) , however, IS 100% FREE, so my view of this scanner (pending how well it detects) is rising again. 

- ![Eset NOD32 Icon](../progIcons/security/AVs/egui_20000.png)[Eset NOD32 Icon]()

	This has REPEATEDLY YEAR AFTER YEAR been ranked number 1 of all the Antiviruses, and noting the comment I have about Kaspersky (see below) ... Its now the clear number 1. I am not saying if you have one of the freeware scanners I list, to go run out and pay for this one, however it does get SOME items even the other scanners miss 


- ![Kasperksy Icon ](../progIcons/security/AVs/585__kaspersky.gif) [Kaspersky](http://www.kaspersky.com)
          
	Oh Kaspersky .. .This one has failed a few tests that NOD32 has passed, however, I still love this scanner. Its been so good to me over the years (about 10 years now ... wow I feel old) ... IF you ask me, this scanner has gotten just a tad (just a little) bloated, however that could be the effect of adding all new Malware detection to it. 
     
	I just cant bring myself to knock this scanner, however, for non-freeware antiviruses, I'd go with NOD32 
      

I am writing about the antiviruses themselves and not any &quot;security suite&quot; made by these companies. Even just a decent antivirus (EVEN IF THAT COMPANY MAKES A &quot;SPYWARE/MALWARE SCANNER&quot;) can detect a good number of the common SpyW/MalW 's .. although if you have one if the decent AV scanners

##Free Antiviruses

- ![Avast Icon](../progIcons/security/AVs/1589__Avast!FreeAntivirus5_icon.png) [ Avast](http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download)
&quot;Neck and Neck&quot; with Avira as my favorite free anti-virus scanner... has numerous ways of progr

- ![Avira Icon](../progIcons/security/AVs/1430__AntiVirPersonal9_icon.png)[ Avira](http://www.avira.com/en/avira-free-antivirus)
Numerous sites not ONLY rate this as the best of the three freeware anti-viruses, but, one of the top 3 to 5 (which number it tends to be varies) AV's &quot;PERIOD&quot;.

- [AVG Icon]()[AVG]()
My least favorite of all the free Antiviruses.. seems to have alot of false alarms AND it has missed a few items from what I have seen (I know all scanners do miss things from time to time, AVG seems to have a higher number of misses I mean)
