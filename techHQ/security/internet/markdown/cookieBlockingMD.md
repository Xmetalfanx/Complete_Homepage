##How to setup Blocking all Cookies by Default: Cookie Safe  AND Cookie Monster

**Cookie Safe** - Open the Cookie Safe Options Box and check (or make sure they are already checked) I have forgotten what are the default settings, so these could be checked by default

-	&quot;<span class="blue">Deny Cookies Globally on Startup</span> &quot;

-	&quot;<span class="blue">Block Third Party Cookies</span>&quot; (Cookies coming not from what site your on, but a third party ... *I am not sure how &quot;You are on Yahoo.com and a cookie is from Yahoo.net (although I am sure there is no Yahoo.net in that example) would work*;

-	and &quot;<span class="blue">Block Cookies when host name can't be resolved</span>&quot;. (I am not sure what this 100% means, though it looks like it may be able to block  cookies that try to be &quot;sneaky&quot; and blocks a browser from knowing what site it came from ... it could also block sites that are having server issues, though in that case I would think that its blocking to &quot;be better safe/secure, then sorry &quot;
