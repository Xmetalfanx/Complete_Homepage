There are two main programs here

    [***Blocklist Manager***](http://www.bluetack.co.uk/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=1)

    (Freeware) -

      - This actually gets the lists from internet databases (like a virus scanner update i guess ... )


    -  ***Protowall***

    (or an old program called &quot;Peer Guardian&quot;... although i am sure Peer Guardian may be able to be gotten around (by the IP's your trying to block... it hasn&#39;t been updated in years, but if there is a 2.0 out, try it as in that WOULD be the new one (2/25/05 is the current date now)(also freeware)

    </span> - This is the program that actually does the blocking....<br />

    - *TIP *: &quot; I cant get to Google !&quot; or &quot; all webcams in yahoo will no longer  work!&quot; ... well that is normal ... i mean if you set too many lists.... all you have to do is


      - After you go to Google (for google for instance otherwise its still the same steps... ) go to the protowall screen and see when its blocking. It should read along the lines of &quot;~Time~ ~Date~ Packet to Google Blocked etc etc ..&quot;

      - Get the Number after &quot;google&quot; (ex 127.0.0.1)                   ...

      - Open Blocklist Manager and go to IMPORT ~~&gt; IP Blocker ~~&gt; Protowall

      - You can look at the range number to see if what you want to remove falls in them, but i found it easier to look at the comment section and Alphabetize it, and then go look under G for Google ... I found about 6 entries that I removed all of ..

      - EXPORT ~~&gt; IP Blocker ~~~&gt; Protowall (if you are prompted to overwrite the file, click YES)

      - Google works fine

        - The same thing happened to me with Yahoo Cams... did the same process for yahoo respectively, and it works.
