For the record, I know this content may be duplicated in &quot;Firefox Tips&quot;.. I figured to make it easier for viewers of my site to get top the content, even if I have to duplicate a few.  
  
I AM NOT SAYING, YOU HAVE TO DO ALL OF THESE, ... pick and choose which ones you want to try. The #1 must have would be NoScript, if you ask me... if you only use one of these ... NoScript is the one to pick ... Most web exploits I have seen can be easliy blocked with NoScript, without any need for the user (that's you) to interact with it.

I am not going to include ad blocknig here, since ads tend to be more of an annoyance than a security threat... I know there are some bad ads out there; however, do not think that Ad blocking is a &quot;security issue&quot; like some of thesze other addons and suggestions
