  <p class="header">Script Blocking
  </p>    
  <p>Scripts can cause havox on your computer if they are malious (NOTE: not all the requests ARE malious. ... many sites NEED scripts to &quot;run properly&quot; .. and there is no problem with this, I just tend to have an issue with sites that have a ton of third party scripts coming from advertising and other third party sites.
  </p>    
  <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  </p>    
  <p>UNFORTUNATELY, not everyone can use NoScript since some people do not care for Firefox. There is NO secret, that I LOVE Firefox, but I respect other's opinion and release that there should be other alternatives for other browsers. 
  </p>    
  <p>THESE do not do &quot;everything&quot; that an updated NoScript can do, though they are improving and everything helps when it comes to these programs.... I mean if you have a cold and 5 symptoms and you can take a medicine that solves 5 of them (without medical issues) ... would you completely refuse it since it was 5 out of 6, instead of 6 out of 6?... Not me

NoScript blocks sites running scripts (while maintaining a white-list (allows) and blacklist (known sites you            want to block) and after you hit allow on your favorite site ... it will not block those scripts you want Firefox to run again. I have seen TONS of articles of &quot;new exploits            &quot; year after year now and many of them say that ( not counting MS patches) the way to protect yourself is to use an updated copy of NoScript with an updated version of             Firefox (you don't have to use 4.x, by the way)
