    <li>I am not claiming this is a &quot;sure-fire&quot; way not to get infected with Malware/Spyware or Viruses, ...etc,         
    <ul>          
      <li>Some of these steps can help limit the chances, but do not use these tips and then think, &quot;Oh .. I do not need an antivirus anymore&quot;. 
      </li>        
    </ul>      
    </li>      
    <li>I am not saying this will block your ISP from seeing what you download via that browser         
    <ul>          
      <li>If they want to, they can see what they want. There is nothing you can do about it... I am not saying they are &quot;Spying&quot; on everything you do, but rather            it's their network and they can do as they please with it <br /><br />
      </li>        
    </ul>      
    </li>      
    <li>This is the &quot;welcome page&quot; for this section, each browser will eventually have a &quot;subpage&quot; on the left tab where you can go directly to your favorite browser's page. 
    </li>      
    <li class="boldUnderline"> Like many tips on my site, These are NOT a &quot;fix all&quot; to secure your computer, though if you follow my steps, it will contribute to the overall protection of your computer
