  <p>Trojans and some viruses attempt to send your personal information such as financial data, or passwords to an outside source.
  Knowing signs of trojans can be very useful.<br /><br />

  Programs attempt to contact the net all the time and like going to the doctor every time you sneeze... its no need to worry with most programs. a common firewall
  can block programs from accessing the net.<br />       		<br />

  Programs such as Winamp, Real Player, Windows Media Player can be accessing the net simply because their default setting is set to &quot;check
  for latest program Update&quot;.

  You can simple disable it (in programs like Real Player it may be reallllllllllllllllly tricky to find this options), or have a firewall not allow it to connect to the net.

	Programs such as SmartFTP (FTP Client) are made to be connecting to the net, of course they should be allowed with a firewall to connect.
