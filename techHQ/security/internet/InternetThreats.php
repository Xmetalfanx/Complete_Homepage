  <p>If you ask me, ANY decent scanner will have the ability to scan for all of these.. not to say they are 100% &quot;perfect&quot; ... also some users (myself included) will use a number of scanners for these (not running in &quot;real time&quot; .. aka the background though) ..
  </p>
  <p>Like Antiviruses, numerous scanners running in the background at the same time, MAY conflict with one another.

        <p>I have recently seen what looks like a basic (that's a GOOD thing) scanner that MAY BE missing &quot;realtime protection&quot; (background scanning) , however, IS 100% FREE, so my view of this scanner (pending how well it detects) is rising again.

IF you ask me, this scanner has gotten just a tad (just a little) bloated, however that could be the effect of adding all new Malware detection to it.

        <p>I just cant bring myself to knock this scanner, however, for non-freeware antiviruses, I'd go with NOD32

  <p>I am writing about the antiviruses themselves and not any &quot;security suite&quot; made by these companies. Even just a decent antivirus (EVEN IF THAT COMPANY MAKES A &quot;SPYWARE/MALWARE SCANNER&quot;) can detect a good number of the common SpyW/MalW 's .. although if you have one if the decent AV scanners
