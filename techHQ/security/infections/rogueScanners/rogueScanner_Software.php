  <p class="header">Common Programs needed to remove these infections
  </p>    
  <p>(If you don't beleive me, go to the BleepingComputer's page that I link to below and you will see they generally all recommend the same programs/apps. Unless noted, all of these programs/tools are 100% free.
  </p>    
  <p class="boldText">Malware (legit of course) Scanners
  </p>    
  <p>
    <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank">MalwareBytes</a> - I am sure I have not seen a tutorial yet that DOESN'T include Malwarebytes.
  </p>    
  <p>
    <a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank">Super Anti-spyware</a> - Not included in tutorials; however, one of the only Malware/Spyware scanners in my opinion that even comes CLOSE to Malwarebytes    
  </p>    
  <p class="boldText">Misc Tools (not always needed, but I for instance have updated copies of all of these &quot;just in case&quot;). These can be used to help clean, badly infected computers:<br />  
  </p>    
  <ul>      
    <li class="justify">
      <a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/combofix/how-to-use-combofix">ComboFix</a> - I have seen ComboFix, first-hand help computers that were badly infected; new users, should only use this if reformatting SEEMS like the only hope, after MalwareBytes &quot;failed'. Note: At that time I had no idea about RKill (listed below) so instead of running Combofix, running RKill THEN Malwarebytes, may have worked as well
    </li>      
    <li class="justify">
      <a href="http://preview.tinyurl.com/2dnzgjf">RKill</a> - Listed on many tutorials as what to use before Malwarebytes on pesky infections that contain rootkits that try to disable Malwarebytes from cleaning your computer
    </li>      
    <li>
    <a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/virus-removal/how-to-use-smitfraudfix">SmitfraudFix</a> - Created to remove rouge scanners and malware
    </li>      
    <li>
    <a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/virus-removal/remove-tdss-tdl3-alureon-rootkit-using-tdsskiller">TDSSKiller</a> - <br />      
    </li>    
  </ul>    
  <p class="boldText">Anti-viruses
  </p>    
  <p>Both of these top two scanners have similar (Great) detection rates and are &quot;neck and neck&quot; as the best Free anti-virus if you ask me. Some sites say Avira is difficult to use, but I disagree.    
  </p>    
  <ul>      
    <li>
    <a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download" target="_blank">Avast</a> - FREE
    </li>      
    <li>
    <a href="http://www.avira.com/en/avira-free-antivirus">Avira</a> - FREE<br />      
    </li>    
  </ul>    
  <blockquote>      
    <p>(extra comments) <br />        
      <span class="boldItalics">Avira Pros
      </span>: NO system lag on any of my computers that I have EVER run it on; 
    </p>      
    <p>
      <span class="boldItalics">Avast Cons
      </span>: My laptop from 2002, has SLIGHT lag running Avast. (compared to Avira).. .new computers run Avast without any system resource lag of any kind (its up to a &quot;computer-by-Computer&quot; basis    
    </p>    
  </blockquote>    
  <p>Those are Free, but if you feel the need to want to pay for one (for whatever reason), try (3) Eset NOD32 , which provides great protection and no system lag
  </p>    
  <p>&nbsp;
  </p>    
  <p class="header">&quot;Wait! ... Some people claim that Free Antivirus dont remove the actual infections, and I have to buy an expensive scanner to actually remove anything&quot; 
  </p>    
  <p>100% FALSE !!
  </p>    
  <p>PLEASE do not let people talk you into &quot;you get what you pay for&quot; .. with the few exceptions, most of my favorite and security site &quot;best programs&quot; are free.
  </p>    
  <p class="boldText">Things Pro (paid) versions of programs tend to have, the free programs do not:
  </p>
  <ul>      
    <li> Better tech support from company when you actualy purchase the software's Pro version         
    <ul>          
      <li>This fact I even question, since at one point,  I had questions for Comodo AND Avast, and (via forum) both responded promptly, and answered my question(s) completely)
      </li>        
    </ul>      
    </li>      
    <li>The detection rate of freewares (like Avast and Avira) are 100% the same.  THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE.
    </li>      
    <li> Paid Programs tend to bundle AV's + Parental Control Software + Firewalls + &quot;Spam blockers&quot; together .          
    <ul>          
      <li>I find that using a different program for certain tasks tend to provde better security and allows me to choose what programs I use for what task.<br />  
      </li>        
    </ul>
