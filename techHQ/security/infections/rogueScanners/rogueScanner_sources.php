  <p>
	These are the resources, in which I get the most of my information. I do not take credit for the actual information, but rather how I formatted and re-worded some Items. The resources I list below 
	ctually provide much more then what I am going off of, and they DESERVE FULL 100% CREDIT for the work they do. If at anytime someone from one of the resources asks me to take this down, I will glady 
	A) work withthem to see what content they want down and what is &quot;OK&quot;. B) Remove content they request removed. (If that comes up (to the resource before you send me email you want the 
	content down) ... I want to say I am sorry.  I am just providing a cumlitive place for people to research common infections... I mean NO HARM)
