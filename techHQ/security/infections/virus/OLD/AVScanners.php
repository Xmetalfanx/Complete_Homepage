#Introduction
  Antiviruses can be a tricky subject.. there are many different &quot;rating&quot; sites and some scanners go up and down all the time.  In my opinion, its like investing .... dont worry about &quot;VSCANNER X HAS RATED #1 ... this time&quot; .... Look over a long period of time and make a desicion.
    
  Eset NOD32, for instance, doesn;t always rank number 1 on all review sites, HOWEVER, it (for example) hasn't missed a Virus Bulletin award for ITW Viruses (viruses not yet in the scanner's database but actually out on the internet)... since 2003 (Its almost October 2010 when i am typing this) 
    
  Also consider the rating site itself .. I have seen &quot;MCAFEE IS #1 OVERALL&quot; on sites and if you hunt through the site, your'll see the site itself is sponsored by Mcafee.
    
   I have also talked to many techs I trust and even they have said they work on alot of infected computers with up-to-date version of Mcafee or Norton on them, so no matter how many sites say &quot;NORTON IS THE BEST&quot; ... they will never recommend it to ANYONE. 
    
   Also I have seen people with completely infected computers unable to install an antivrus and say &quot;oh that AV stinks&quot; ... some of those viruses (if put on a system with no AV, ARE CODED TO BLOCK AV installs ... Install your AV choice BEFORE your infected.
   AND FOLKS ..DON'T RESTORE YOUR COMPUTER WITH A RESTORE POINT TO AN EARLIER INFECTED TIME AND THEN BLAME THE ANTIVIRUS ![oh no smile](../../smiles/yahoo_Smiles/ohGeez.gif)
    
##Antiviruses
   NOT ALL FREE ANTIVIRUSES ARE EQUAL.... ALTHOUGH IF YOU ASK ME, THEY ARE ALL better than Mcafee, Norton, and even PC-Cillin. Out of the top 3 free AV's (I am NOT counting Comodo's AV). ... i know AVG rates the worst, consistantly (keep in mind what I just said above).  Avira is the one i have on family members computers, and it does have some false alarms .... Avast I have never used, but it seems to have gained ground on Avira.
  
A point I want to make is that Avira rates very high (FOR ANY) ... FREE OR PAY-FOR antivirus, </p>

        <td><p>This one is tricky ... I dont base what I use on my computer on  a single review .. I base it reviews over a period of time (say Eset NOD32 ... it isn't always number 1 for whatever reason, but in many different tests, it hasn't missed a &quot;Passing as one of the top scanners&quot; , since 2003) </p>
        <p>Getting back on topic, depending on what you have the settings on, it may contain some false alarms.. In many cases I know the security &quot;testers&quot; I have and/or programs like Winhex are detected as intrusions, and I KNOW THEY ARE A-OK  </p>
        <p>Detection-wise ... This is all over the board, but I have notice</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Out of the 3 free antiviruses, this always seems to rate highest ... sometimes Avast ratese higher but like I said ... time after time after time ... Avira <span class="italics">USUALLY</span> rates higest of the 3 </li>
          <li>(the freeware) Rates ALOT better then many other PAY-FOR antiviruses</li>
          <li>some recent reviews, have it as detecting just as good (again.. the freeware) as Eset NOD32 (A TOP ANTIVIRUS FOR ALMOST A DECADE) </li>

          <p>NOD32 has a small &quot;footprint&quot; (doesn't take a ton of resources ..etc etc ... AND (I will have to check how up-to-date this is) ... Apparently hasn't failed a VirusBulletin ITW (In-the-Wild) test (done every few months).. since 2003..</p>
          <p>I am willing to give Kaspersky another chance, but no matter what some of the ranikings &quot;of the moment&quot; say ... I am sticking with NOD32</p></td>

        <p>I have tried a few of the recent versions and even the Antivirus (not the &quot;Security suite&quot; in otherwords) ... It still feels like the  last time I tried it .. BLOATED .. dont get me wrong, not like Symantec's or Mcafee's Antivirus, but still .. detection going down (apparently) and the fact its getting bloated ... Kaspersky is going in the wrong direction if you ask me ,,,</p></td>
