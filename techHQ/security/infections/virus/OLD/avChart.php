  <p>When I say antivirus &quot;rating&quot; I am looking at the overall picture... I am not just looking at the interface (although I do consider it), I do not look at JUST the protection,      AND DESPITE WHAT SOME &quot;LAB TESTS&quot; will show ... I take real world experience into account. Whats the point of an antivirus that has so-so protection, COST MONEY, has a &quot;pretty&quot;      interface, and slows your computer down worse then 1/2 the viruses it &quot;protects&quot; you against?.

        <p>May 2012 update: AVG is a tricky one.. 
        </p>          
        <p>I am not one to go solely on &quot;lab tests&quot; alone, though I have to admit from various sources, such as PCWorld.com... AVG has been getting better reviews 
          <span class="italics">(note: the 2012 free version).. I 
          </span>am not one to constantly knock a product, IF they are improving it.. I may re-evaluate my &quot;not recommending AVG&quot; stance... 
          <span class="boldUnderline">IF
          </span> it is better now, I will gladly recommend it. 
        </p>          
        <p>AVG from my experience with helping users, is problematic, though as I just stated, they may be improving it., and I will gladly recommend it, if it's better now. 
        </p>          
        <p>I am still seeing users with AVG 
          <span class="italics">(not sure on a case to case basis which verison they have)
          </span> having problems with viruses getting right by AVG, though some review &quot;lab tests&quot; say its now the best. ... I can not honestly explain this. 
          <span class="maroonText">(Note: those users who are &quot;not very good with computers&quot; in their own words, remove AVG, ... Install Avast and Avast removes the infection no problem)

        </p></td>      
    </tr>    
  </table>    
  <p>I have repeated seen &quot;You get what you pay for&quot; ... This is not always the case ... with many products I find the store brand is just as good as the name brand and at 1/2 to 3/4 the cost. 
  </p>
  <p>With antiviruses, even &quot;not so good&quot; freewares rate better than Norton and/or Mcafee. Looking at a few review sites the rate of detection is overall the same ... I have seen say Avast do better then Avira in one catagory ... then Avira do better then
