  <p>Many people fall victim to viruses due to not knowing some basic common  sense when it comes to computer viruses and how to prevent them from infecting  your computer. This page will 
  hopefully educate those so they don't have         problems with viruses again.

  <p class="header"> How NOT to get viruses (prevent viruses that that)

    <li>          
    <p class="justify">OK, I have already posted my Antivirus Recommendations, so I am not gonna redo that.. ANYWAY, NOT all Antivirus are the same...   Some have worse detection rates, and 
	even if the detection is ok... it slows down the computer too much... I WOULD TELL EVERYONE to run an antivirus ....            time and time again I have had to help people that said &quot;
	Norton slowed my computer down too much, so i removed it and now have no antivirus what so ever&quot;.

  <p class="header">Virus Myth 1: Viruses come in common image formats
  </p>      
  <ol>        
    <li>Viruses do NOT come in images. There MIGHT be one or two exceptions to that however.           
    <ul>            
      <li> Common Image formats are 
      </li>          
    </ul>        
    </li>          
    <span style="color: #000000; font-family: Courier New, Courier, mono;">JPG, GIF, BMP, Tif(f), PNG
    </span>          
    <span class="justify">Images that are not in those formats are possible viruses. Don't get me wrong, total there are TONNNNNNNNNNNNNS OF image formats.  
	Those that I listed are just the most common ones.

    <blockquote>          
      <p class="justify">Many users are tricked into downloading and running files that have                   double extensions. The real extension is that last part of the file                   and since the extension for all known (to a particular computer and                   install) file formats are hidden, many virus writers .... or script                   kiddies depend on this. You see a file named &quot;picture.jpg.vbs&quot; and               you download it you will end up seeing &quot;picture.jpg&quot;. 
      </p>          
      <p class="justify">&quot;Well!, its a Jpg Image !.... open it!&quot; ... WRONG !            
        <img src="../../smiles/group/spank.gif" alt="spank smile" width="50" height="44" /> ... Windows by default hides &quot;.vbs&quot;            which is a visual basic script (I am NOT saying             that viruses are  in visual basic script files only).
      </p>          
      <p class="justify">You can Look at my Antivirus Chart for opinions                     and ratings but for a good Free (no ad or spyware) Antivirus, go                     get 
        <a href="http://www.grisoft.com" target="_blank">AVG</a>. Its                     not the &quot;prettiest&quot; Antivirus, but it has rated above many               of the others and its free (although there is a pro version).

    <p class="justify"><strong>(February 25, 2005) Another thing to note</strong>: Some Windows Explorer (some think of &quot;my computer&quot; in windows ... whatever ) replacements like 
      <a href="http://www.gpsoft.com.au/" target="_blank"> Directory Opus </a>does show extensions, so if you see an PictureName.jpg file in 	         there, it is

    <p>Covered this already in the P2p Section - short answer (go to the link for details) yes and no .... 
    </p>        
    <p>Yes they can spread by double extenstion files as noted with image files, above.. but the common myth part of it is that you can get them with the mp3 files... FALSE FALSE FALSE !... many p2p apps do come with spyware, which at times can act like a virus, but its NOT THE MP3 that is the virus
