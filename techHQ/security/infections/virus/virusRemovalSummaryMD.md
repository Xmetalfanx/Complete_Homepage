If you have the &quot;Anti(virus/spyware) 2009&quot; Infection and what information about what it is and how to remove it,   <a href="fakeAV_2009.php"> 
please click here to go to my &quot;special page&quot; on that infection</a>. It seem MANY MANY people have been fooled and downloaded these  fake applications 

  
I am making this page to summarize the steps you should take If you think you have a virus/trojan or spyware infection

*** &quot;HELP, I HAVE GOTTEN A VIRUS (OR I THINK I HAVE) .. .WHAT DO I DO? &quot; ***


    ** Do not panic ** 
    -   when I was new to computers, I even &quot;panicked&quot; and deleted a legit file I thought was part of the infection that wasn't ...  in short,
     I made the problem MUCH MUCH WORSE.

    *** Realize that not all Antiviruses/Anti-spyware/Anti-Malware programs are the same as how good they are.  ***

    saw ... in small print there is &quot;Sponsored by Microsoft&quot; ... so OF COURSE Microsoft is going to say there product is best.)

    <span class="boldText">May 2012 update
    </span>: AVG is a tricky one.. 
  </p>    
  <p>I am not one to go solely on &quot;lab tests&quot; alone, though I have to admit from various sources, such as PCWorld.com... AVG has been getting better reviews (note: the 2012 free version).. I am not one to constantly knock a product, IF they are improving it.. I may re-evaluate my &quot;not recommending AVG&quot; stance... IF it is better now, I will gladly recommend it. 
  </p>    
  <p>AVG from my experience with helping users, is problematic, though as I just stated, they may be improving it.<br />
