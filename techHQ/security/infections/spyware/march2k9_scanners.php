  <p>Not all spyware scanners are created equal and in fact some do not perform well at all. I plan to not onlly say what I have found, but to give a few external links to PROVE it.
  </p>      
  <p>I know I am not going to list &quot;every scanner&quot; out there, so here is a list of the scanners I will be including in my comments:
  </p>      
  <ul>        
    <li>Lavasoft Adaware - Freeware 
    </li>        
    <li>Spybot Search and Destroy - Freeware 
    </li>        
    <li>Spy Blaster - Freeware 
    </li>        
    <li>Spyware Doctor - Shareware 
    </li>        
    <li>
    <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank">Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware</a> - Freeware 
    </li>        
    <li>SUPERAntiSpyware - Freeware
    </li>

  <p>I have said it alot to friends recently and now numerous sites back it up. 
    <span class="style2">The first two listed (above) that have been the &quot;kings of spyware scanners' for a number of years are no longer the best.
    </span> I have found some sites saying &quot;eh .. .Ad-aware is not too bad, .. .not the best, but not too bad&quot;; while responses for Spybot have been (at best) &quot;in a test of a number of different spywares a scanner can detect .. .it ONLY got 30% of them&quot;. 
  </p>      
  <p>
    <span class="boldItalics">Note
    </span>: I am not taking a personal interest (I dont have friends at any of these companies) nor do I intended to take &quot;personal shots&quot; at the programmers. I respect what Spybot use to be (best spyware scanner out) BUT I JUST NOW want to inform users that use those products and ONLY those that there are better choices out there. 
  </p>      
  <p class="header">Whats the Best Spyware scanner, then ??!? 
  </p>      
  <p> I find using a number of different freewares is good. Most Hard drives are not &quot;that small&quot; that installing one more freeware Spyware scanner will really take up that much space, either. 
  </p>      
  <p>
    <span class="boldItalics">NOTE
    </span>: JUST BECAUSE ONE PRODUCT IS FREE OR PAY FOR ... DOESNT MEAN IT'S BETTER OR WORSE THEN OTHERS ... Most (with a few exceptions) free scanners are actually just as good as any pay-for scanners
  </p>      
  <p>I have read (
    <em>however, as I said I want to see the same reviews in a number of different TRUSTED sources
    </em>) that 
    <span class="redtext">SUPERAntiSpyware
    </span> (freeware) is one of the better ones out there right now (I am talking free products). I have seen this one on a number of sites such as Filehippo.com, but never gave it much thought before
  </p>      
  <p>One I have seen rate high and I know from using it on a number of machines that it performs well, is 
    <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware</strong></a>. It has quickly become one of my MUST HAVE windows spyware scanners
  </p>      
  <p>
    <span class="boldItalics">NOTE:
    </span> Spyware Blaster is a different sort of anti-spyware tool. To be honest ... its not really a spyware scanner; although its in my must have of spyware &quot;tools&quot;. It basically blocks active-x &quot;Drive-by&quot; spyware downloads. It DOESN'T actually scan for spyware, but blocks it from being installed (as I said, Active-x Spyware installs) ... If you install a spyware loaded program, it may not have any effect on that type of spyware
