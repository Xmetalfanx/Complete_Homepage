I am not going to list &quot;What Spyware is&quot; since I have done that on other parts of the site. The Bottom line is that you dont want Spyware/adware/Malware on your computer. They can be just as (or MORE) of a nucenes then viruses 

Like antiviruses, not all spyware scanners are &quot;equal&quot;.I only use a few scanners (and a big dose of common sense!) and I feel perfectly safe. You can look at the [Security Software page](../../software/securityPrograms.php) of my site for more entries, but these are the ones I use and trust the most. Malware Bytes .. I can NOT SAY ENOUGH ABOUT... its FANTASTIC ... it fills the void left by Spybot which (detection-wise) has gone &quot;way done&quot; in almost all the reviews in the past few years.

(Jan 2010) My Now Favorite spyware/malware scanner 
     
This has saved a few headaches on computers I have worked on. I had thought that I was going to have to redo alot of things (maybe even reformat), but with Malware Bytes, ... 
1.	 I scanned for spyware/malware 
2.	 It found and removed some of the mailware, 
2.	 It  had to reboot to safe mode to remove the rest. 
2.	 I rescanned the system and the system was clean
     
PLEASE NOTE: the last example depends on the *actual* malware a PC is infected with ... 
          
Detection wise, Malwarebytes is  THE BEST out there.
  
And although there is a pro version, Malware Bytes is completely free

Spyware Blaster works in a different way then other anti-spyware programs.  You don't necessarily have to have a spyware program installed  in your system to download spyware. In some cases (ones that I just found out for myself), webmasters have become more creative in creating websites where all you have to do is visit the &quot;infected&quot; website to get spyware.           Spyware Blaster install &quot;kill bit&quot; that prevents  the active-x Spyware from even installing in the first place.       

This is CONSTANTLY being updated. I w0uld not use this  alone, however... I use this jointly with Spybot, and found that the creators  of Spybot have added features to help tie these two programs &quot;together&quot;.

Second best Anti-spyware scanner, (next to 
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org" target="_blank">Malware Bytes</a>), if you ask me. This program, even I sometime, forget. 
 
This is very unfortunate, since I would consider this a ***&quot;must have&quot;*** program
