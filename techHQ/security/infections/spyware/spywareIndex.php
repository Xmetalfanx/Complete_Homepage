  <p>I am not going to list &quot;What Spyware is&quot; since I have done that on other parts of the site. The Bottom line is that you dont want Spyware/adware/Malware on your computer. They can be just as (or MORE) of a nucenes then viruses 
  </p>    
  <p>Like antiviruses, not all spyware scanners are &quot;equal&quot;.I only use a few scanners (and a big dose of common sense!) and I feel perfectly safe. You can look at the 
    <a href="../../software/securityPrograms.php">security software page </a>of my site for more entries, but these are the ones I use and trust the most. Malware Bytes .. I can NOT SAY ENOUGH ABOUT... its FANTASTIC ... it fills the void left by Spybot which (detection-wise) has gone &quot;way done&quot; in almost all the reviews in the past few years.

        <p class="redBold">(Jan 2010) My Now Favorite Spyware/Malware scanner 
        </p>        
        <p>This has saved a few headaches on computers I have worked on. I had thought that I was going to have to redo alot of things (maybe even reformat), but with Malware Bytes, ... 1) I scanned for spyware/malware 2) it found and removed some of the mailware, 3) it had to reboot to safe mode to remove the rest. 4) i rescanned the system and the system was clean
        </p>        
        <p>PLEASE NOTE: the last example depends on the 
          <span class="italics">actual
          </span> malware a PC is infected with ... 
        </p>        
        <p>Detection wise, Malwarebytes is  THE BEST out there.
        </p>        
        <p>And although there is a pro version, Malware Bytes is completely free

        <p class="justify"> Spyware Blaster           works in a different way then other anti-spyware programs.           You don't necessarily have to have a spyware program installed           in your system to download spyware. In some cases (ones           that I just found out for myself), webmasters have become           more creative in creating websites where all you have to           do is visit the &quot;infected&quot; website to get spyware.           Spyware Blaster install &quot;kill bit&quot; that prevents           the active-x Spyware from even installing in the first place.           This is CONSTANTLY being updated. I w0uld not use this           alone, however... I use this jointly with Spybot,           and found that the creators  of Spybot have added features           to help tie these two programs &quot;together&quot;.
