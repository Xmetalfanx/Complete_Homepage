        Norton Power Eraser</a><br/> note that I have seen people say this can not run if you have Kasperksy installed because it may conflict with the driver or some service that Kaspersky runs.</li>

      <div class="pb-3">I admit I am slightly out of the loop here in early 2020 to which is the best scanners, since I no longer use Windows, though I ususually see people that know what they are doing testing these things and on test systems using some product (say the subject of the review they are currently doing), AND THEN they usually use say Zenmana and/or (this one I see constantly) Hitman Pro as a "second opinion scanner" to see what the first scanner missed.</div>

      <div class="pb-3">Last I saw Malwarebytes detection WAS falling a bit, but that may change, as code improves.</div>
      <div>Emsisoft use to have a more basic version of their paid offering, for free but I am having issues finding that now.  STILL THAT DOESN'T MATTER.... along with Hitman Pro and Zemana, I have seen the same people 100% trust Emsisoft for a second opinion scanner too.</div>
