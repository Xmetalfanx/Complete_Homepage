        div I am not commenting on their detection rate ... that may be good enough ... it's the fact that they ever (and after public backlash they said they stopped this) sold users data in the first place.  This is suppose to be a security "app/program" company.  The fact they ever thought this was a good idea, worries me.
        br/
        div Also please remember that CCleaner (a FORMER must have program) for me, is/has been owned by Avast for awhile now ... I have personally switched to BleachBit on my only remaining Windows system.
