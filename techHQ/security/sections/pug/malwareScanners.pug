div Emsisoft use to have a more basic version of their paid offering, for free but I am having issues finding that now.  STILL THAT DOESN'T MATTER.... along with Hitman Pro and Zemana, I have seen the same people 100% trust Emsisoft for a second opinion scanner too.

div * Just note that I have seen people say this can not run if you have Kasperksy installed because it may conflict with the driver or some service that Kaspersky runs.
