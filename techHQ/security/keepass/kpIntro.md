#Introduction 

I have decided to put up a sort of tips and tricks section for Keepass, of things I have found/learned while using it.  

This will not be a full tutorial on "how to setup an entry", though it will probably contain 

-	How to migrate your Lastpass data to Keepass2
-	How to get that blasted auto-type issue other control 
	-	How to modify Keepass to fill 

###My (past) Experience with Keepass2 

I have to state that I had been a Keepass user for years before I ever signed up for Lastpass. 

*I was more of a Firefox only user than .... other browsers for testing things... now I go between browsers*

**I fully admit I am testing different Lastpass alternative solutions out, and while making these pages, I may decide to not to use Keepass, myself as a long-term solution**
