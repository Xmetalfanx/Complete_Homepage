<p>
  Ok.. here is a page I have let get away from me ... oh well ... lets
  start over anyway
</p>
<p class="boldTitles">Popup Blockers</p>
<p>
  I will not waste anyone&apos;s time with &quot;what is a popup&quot;
  ... everyone on the net has seen them, and to be honest, NOT ALL
  POPUP BLOCKERS are alike... alot claim to block stuff, but need a TON
  of customizing and they ... STILL DONT WORK ALL THE TIME ... well
  don&apos;t get ...

<p class="header">There have been three popup blockers I have used/use that I give a thumbs up</p>
<ul>
  <li class="justify"><strong>Popup Killer (FW/Open Source)</strong> - In the days of
        windows 9x, Loved this program... its good, configurrable. you can
        save blacklists and whitelists... but to be honest, they stopped
        development and the open Source version i tried, .... kind of fell
        flat.... no so much &quot;cause this program sucks&quot;, but
        because popups have gotten more advanced to get around those old
        blockers.<br/>
  </li>  
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.popupcop.com" target="_blank">Popup Cop (SW)</a></strong> -
           here is one if you use IE (not sure about IE
        clone) as your default browser, but it will not work in any other
        browser . .. it has a
        TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON of options, and features,... i could probably
        make a whole site (not page) just to describe it ... alot of the
        previously mentioned &quot;smart popups&quot; can be detected and
        removed without any user interaction... if you want a popup (say a
        prompt on a site is being blocked... one you know you need to see),
        just click enable popups on this site
  </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.admuncher.com" target="_blank"><img src="../../../progIcons/security/ad_muncher.png" alt="Ad Muncher Icon"/></a>
  <ul></ul>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.admuncher.com" target="_blank">Ad Muncher</a></strong>This works in all programs... from web browsers IE, Opera, Mozilla, Firefox, (any IE clone), Paltalk... 
    and although i have not tried it this way, Yahoo messanger and adware programs.... This is a GREAT TOOL, 
    that although I love Popup Cop... I really do... this is just a notch or two above ... This blocks alot like
    Popup Cop.. it doesn&apos;t need alot of user interaction, but if you need to set it up so it doesn&apos;t block on 
    a certain site, its a piece of  cake to do...
  </li>
</p>
<p>
  Many non-IE (thats counting IE clones) have built in popup blockers that do very well .. I do not have the
  URL at the moment, but several sites put 3 sup rd party popup blockers up against some of the
   built in blockers and the built in blockers rated much higher. All of these (if you have one that doesn&apos;t ...
  you do not have a good one) have exception lists, so if
   you find its blocking too much... just tell it not to block a particular item ... OR on a particular page
</p>
<p class="header">&quot;Non Internet Explorer Browsers &quot; that have great popup blockers</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="boldUnderline">Internet Explorer Clones</span>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="boldUnderline"><a href="http://www.avant.com">Avant</a></span> - Not to be outdone ... this is VERY simple to Maxthon ... but yet different in some ways ...
         try both and see for yourself
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li><span><a href="http://www.firefox.com" target="_blank"><img src="../../progIcons/browsers/firefox_1.png" alt="Firefox Icon" width="36" height="36"/> Firefox</a></span>      - This is the biggest (IMHO) alternative to IE right now ... not counting when I am testing my site in
      other browsers, this is the one I use all the time for regular use.
</ul>
