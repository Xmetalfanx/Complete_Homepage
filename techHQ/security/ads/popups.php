          I will not waste anyone&#39;s time with &quot;what is a popup&quot;
          ... everyone on the net has seen them, and to be honest, NOT ALL
          POPUP BLOCKERS are alike... alot claim to block stuff, but need a TON
          of customizing and they ... STILL DONT WORK ALL THE TIME ... well
          don&#39;t get ... </p>

          There have been three popup blockers I have used/use that I give a
          thumbs up        </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="justify">
            <strong>Popup Killer (FW/Open Source)</strong> - In the days of
            windows 9x, Loved this program... its good, configurrable. you can
            save blacklists and whitelists... but to be honest, they stopped
            development and the open Source version i tried, .... kind of fell
            flat.... no so much &quot;cause this program sucks&quot;, but
            because popups have gotten more advanced to get around those old
            blockers.<br />
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong><a href="http://www.popupcop.com" target="_blank">Popup Cop (SW)</a></strong> - here is one if you use IE (not sure about IE
            clone) as your default browser, but it will not work in any other
            browser . .. it has a
            TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON of options, and features,... i could probably
            make a whole site (not page) just to describe it ... alot of the
            previously mentioned &quot;smart popups&quot; can be detected and
            removed without any user interaction... if you want a popup (say a
            prompt on a site is being blocked... one you know you need to see),
            just click enable popups on this site          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="http://www.admuncher.com" target="_blank"><img src="../../../progIcons/security/ad_muncher.png" alt="Ad Muncher Icon" width="31" height="31" class="iconsLeft" /></a></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong><a href="http://www.admuncher.com" target="_blank">Ad Muncher</a></strong>-
            This works in all programs... from web browsers IE, Opera, Mozilla,
            Firefox, (any IE clone), Paltalk... and although i have not tried
            it this way, Yahoo messanger and adware programs.... This is a
            GREAT TOOL, that although I love Popup Cop... I really do... this
            is just a notch or two above ... This blocks alot like Popup Cop...
            it doesn&#39;t need alot of user interaction, but if you need to
            set it up so it doesn&#39;t block on a certain site, its a piece of
            cake to do...          </li>
        </ul>
<p>Many non-IE (thats counting IE clones) have built in popup blockers that do very well .. I do not have the URL at the moment, but several sites put 3<sup>rd</sup> party popup blockers up
 against some of the built in blockers and the built in blockers rated much higher. All of these (if you have one that doesn't ... you do not have a good one) have exception lists, so if 
 you find its blocking too much... just tell it not to block a particular item ... OR on a particular page </p>
        <p class="header">&quot;Non Internet Explorer Browsers &quot; that have great popup blockers </p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="boldUnderline">Internet Explorer Clones</span>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="boldUnderline"><a href="http://www.maxthon.com" target="_blank">Maxthon</a></span>
                - Free IE Clone with a TON more options (BTW ... i would download and use maxthon before downloading IE7 ... 
                IE7 doesn't even COMPARE to the features of Maxthon
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="boldUnderline"><a href="http://www.avant.com">Avant</a> </span>
              - Not to be outdone ... this is VERY simple to Maxthon ... but yet different in some ways ... 
              try both and see for yourself</li>
          </ul>
          <li><span class="boldUnderline"><a href="http://www.firefox.com" target="_blank"><img src="../../progIcons/browsers/firefox_1.png" alt="Firefox Icon" width="36" height="36" class="iconsLeft" /> Firefox</a></span>
            - This is the biggest (IMHO) alternative to IE right now ... not counting when I am testing my site in
          other browsers, this is the one I use all the time for regular use. </li>
