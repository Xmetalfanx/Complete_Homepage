Encryption can be a tricky thing to explain and I will try to find links of all types (for newbies as well as in dept explanations for power users) to help me explain it.
 
Before you can read an encrypted file, you have to decrypt it first (or hack it.... lets not get too technical)... a normal file you just double-click and it opens in its associated program. There are many types of encryption, and TO LET YOU ALL KNOW, just because a file is encrypted, it does not mean its unreadable by anyone... there are many &quot;hackers/crackers&quot; that can break older algorithms in Unix. .... 

 
the way I look at it... its like putting a lock on your font door and locking your windows... if your on vacation, a burglar can still get in (say a hacker for your computer..).. but if the doors have several layers of encryption or whatnot over them, the hacker would probably be more apt to go after the house that &quot;still has its door wide open&quot;...

 
**** KEYLOGGERS AND TROJANS - These are pesky little &quot;programs&quot; that some consider the same as trojans or viruses... it DOESN'T MATTER how well you trust your encryption program, a hacker can get full access WITH EASE.  <img src="../smiles/yahoo_Smiles/yahooDoh.gif" alt="Yahoo Doh Smile" width="32" height="24" />
  
 
- How? Ok...         
1. You download (or some spouse, child, whatever) a &quot;cool&quot; (i say &quot;lame&quot;) program to kick people out of chat rooms, or &quot;hack&quot; others...    

2. This is infected with trojans and keyloggers/viruses.... 

3. The Trojan is like a little guy hiding in your house ... you lock the doors ..etc etc ... but when you go to bed, this guy unlocks them from the inside for the hackers to get in... 

4. The hacker is now in your computer and has access to your files.
   <span class="mainSiteUpdates"> I will kind of steer toward PGP's way of doing this </span> 
   . This gives them access to download your personal keys to their computer

6. 5. &quot;But But ... my PGP files have a Password too ! &quot; ![Biting Nails Smile](techHQ/smiles/yahoo_Smiles/fingerNails.gif) . Ahhhhhhhhhh... but here is where the keylogger comes in ... a Keylogger captures every keystroke and sends it back to the hacker... FROM google.com's &quot; How to stop hackers&quot; to YOUR PASSWORDS... everything.

    - Well There are all kinds of people yelling &quot;get a router and network ...blah blah &quot; While true for cable modem users, alot of this advanced stuff is not needed for a single computer on a dialup (phone line) connection.             
      <ol>              
       1. **Get a firewall**to show you random and UNKNOWN programs trying to contact the internet. This will NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT PREVENT trojans from being installed on your computer, but this will help you spot them.                 
        - Many will say &quot;get this one&quot; or &quot;get that one&quot;... the two best software firewalls I think (other then using another machine with Linux and something like Smoothwall) are 
          **Sygate ** and <span class="boldText">Outpost </span>
          </li>                
        </ul>              
        </li>              
        <li>
        ** Get a Spyware Scanner **
        . Get one like 
        <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security/spyware/software)" target="_blank">Microsoft Antispyware </a>or 
        <a href="http://security.kolla.de/)" target="_blank">Spybot: Search and Destroy</a>. This will help you find many of those mentioned, Keyloggers. There are MANY other good tools for this as well, so don't think i am saying those two are the only good ones 
        </li>              
        <li> Get a GOOD Antivirus. Many viruses seem to slip past Norton, Mcafee, and even AVG. I really like Kaspersky AND Bit Defender (although Kaspersky, i like more).. These two DO THE JOB, and do it 
        <span class="boldText">before
        </span> your infected .
        </li>            
      </ol>          
      </li>        
    </ul>      
    </li>    
  </ul>

Encryption can be a tricky subject. Once &quot;unbreakable code&quot; can now be broken in minutes thanks to advances in technology and the work of hackers and crackers (the difference between Hacker and Cracker I am not getting into right now ... that's another subject). I am in now way claiming to be an expert of the subject, and I will use that (that unlike some topics on this site I know a bit about) I am just learning some of this stuff too. What programs are &quot;best&quot; are always changing and it really seems to be the encryption algorithm and security measures that they use. For Example, what's the use of putting a lock on your front door (do they come without any locks anyway?) ... if EVERYONE knows the key is under the mat ... kind of defeats the purpose of a lock if you ask me. 

You should (and not even just with encrypted files, but with passwords for websites that you have) a longer passphrase, with numbers and characters mixed. One key point to remember is not to make it  too complicated. What's the use of installing the best system for security in your home with a &quot;key&quot; to get in, if YOU DON'T KNOW it either. There are a ton of other suggestions for passwords, however instead of listing them all on my site, I will probably link to websites and good books I have found on the subject.
