This is a collection of programs that I have found that will patch and fix numerous problems with Windows XP.&nbsp; Most of these programs will need to be ran once, and perhaps you to click &quot;patch&quot; or &quot;fix&quot;. I recommend reading the options/help file for each of these as some of them may cause functionality of your computer to change.&nbsp; Bugoff in particular will note what functions may no longer work. I also can not claim  that all of these programs work&nbsp; (i guess you'd have to be a real hacker to test if they patch some of the exploits); although, I believe that they do.

This patches some ports that common worms use.&nbsp; I am sure a good hacker can find other ways into your system; although, you'll be more likely to run into script kiddies (want-to-be hackers, who use programs created by other people to do immature acts, such as kick people out of a particular chat room), or fill the room with useless text, so that no one can see who is &quot;really talking&quot;
