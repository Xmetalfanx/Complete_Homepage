<p><strong>Late October 2010 Message:</strong> I have read alot of &quot;the internet is out to get you!&quot; type posts and
      articles in magazines.

  If you don not know what your doing, and do not take a few simple steps, you can really have a mess on your computer;
  however, in a way... I think some of these things are blown out of proportion to be honest, You DO NEED to secure yourself
  online; however, it seems alot of these articles are trying to push security programs, where if you pay attention closely, you
  will see the companies that have the &quot;best ratings&quot; actually pay to have advertisements placed in that magazine
</p>    
<p>
  I am NOT going to &quot;name names&quot; (Magazines OR Security products), but I will say ... read real life users reviews,
  and go on what your experiences are
</p>
<p>Remember - Just because your anti-virus or malware scanner says you :</p>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;Are infected&quot; does not make it true, if it is a poor scanner</li>
  <li>&quot;Are not infected&quot; does not mean you are not, again ... if its a poor scanner</li>
</ul>
