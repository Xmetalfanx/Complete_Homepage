p Remember - Just because your anti-virus or malware scanner says you:
ul
  li "Are infected" does not make it true, if it is a poor scanner
  li "Are not infected" does not mean you are not, again ... if its a poor scanner

    .pb-3 I admit I am slightly out of the loop here in early 2020 to which is the best scanners, since I no longer use Windows, though I ususually see people that know what they are doing testing these things and on test systems using some product (say the subject of the review they are currently doing), AND THEN they usually use say Zenmana and/or (this one I see constantly) Hitman Pro as a "second opinion scanner" to see what the first scanner missed.
    .pb-3 Last I saw Malwarebytes detection WAS falling a bit, but that may change, as code improves.
    div Emsisoft use to have a more basic version of their paid offering, for free but I am having issues finding that now. STILL THAT DOESN'T MATTER.... along with Hitman Pro and Zemana, I have seen the same people 100% trust Emsisoft for a second opinion scanner too.
