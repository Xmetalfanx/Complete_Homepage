##COMING SOON TO THIS GUIDE 
- Addons for Media lookup
	-  These is similar to id3 tag lookup for mp3s, though when A) your files are named correctly, and B) you have the right addons, ……. you can pull down info on videos files as well as audio files …
	- Then when your collection is big enough, you can browse to various menus and say navigate to all items in your collection where actor “BLAH” is in the movie and/or show.   (This concept really works better with a larger collection, then a few  files)

##To view a video on a flash drive or external hdd
(Once desired media in ON the flash drive)



1. Insert flash drive into USB slot

2. In the media center (whatever one you have) go to ****System**** then ****File Manager****
3. Now go to ****Add Source**** at the bottom, there navigate to ****Browse****
(where it says browse turns bright Blue)

4. Go to ****Root File System**** and then the ****Media**** ... (there my USB drive pops right up) ... go into the root of the USB drive and then use the "right key" on the keyboard to navigate to ****OK****

5. Back in the box that appeared during step 3, use the down arrow key to navigate to ****OK**** ... renaming the source (in the box above *OK* and *Cancel*, if desired)


6. Hit ****ESC**** (perhaps a few times) to get back to the main Kodi menu
(I REALLY FORGOT if the new source is auto-added or not, but i will use a Video as an example)...

7.  (Video Example ) On the *main*  ****Kodi screen****,

8.  Go to ****VIDEOS**** then ****FILES**** ... 
 - *for me the USB drive "source" is listed, if not you can probably add it navigating NOT to the path in step 4, but adding the SOURCE that you named in step 5. (alot faster way to get to the same location)* 


###*** IF THE USB SOURCE did not appear automatically
1. Go to ****Videos****, 
2. Then ****Files****, and ****Add Video****

3.  Use right arrow to go to Browse
4.  Select the SOURCE that you named in step 5, (above) 
5.  Click OK
