*found via [Kodi Wiki](http://kodi.wiki/view/Supplemental_tools)*

***Please also note that when I say "Kodi" I could mean "RasBMC", Kodi, OpenElec, or XMBC (that may not even be the ful list)***

The featurs listed are just basic features and these can get really complex ... I tried them all the past few days and they all have pros and cons ...however, I would NOT be listing any of them here if there were too many Cons.
