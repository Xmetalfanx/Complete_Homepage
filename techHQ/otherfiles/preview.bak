    <div class="UpdateSummary" style="clear:both;float:left;">Site undergoing major layout update <span class="updateDate">November 27, 2013</span></div>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="clear:both;">
    <span class="boldUnderline">December 8, 2013</span> : I have been putting the final touches on the software section's layout change (the colors, font, ...etc I can change on all of the pages, by editing just one CSS page). The Comments/Descriptions of the programs will be adjusted to be more helpful explaining what they are and what they can do.</p>
    <p>I have gone back and forth with XHTML 1 vs the newer HTML5, and while I know: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>HTML5 is newer</li>
      <li>Not every Browser Supports HTML5 (though with the rapid release cycle of many web browsers, most do) .. 
        <ul>
          <li>Say Firefox for instance. At the time I am typing this, version 25 is the newest &quot;stable&quot; (not a test release) version out. I could be wrong, though I beleive I see that HTML5 in general was supported since version 16 </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p> (continuing the sentence), HTML5 is new enough now that it's worth changing to. Unless I messed something up, viewers of my page should not notice any differences (really the change is only one line of code on each page, being changed) when viewing the page. The change was brought on by be validating the site's code and seeing that with XHTML1 the site had more errors, .. with HTML5, more of the code I had anyway, validates to the new standard (I say that losely... alot of its the same)</p>
    <p>The reason I had NOT changed until now is that while I thought web browser supported, they didn't support it enough and some of my site may have been &quot;un-viewable&quot;, when I thought of changing it the last time.</p>
    <p><span class="underline">One last note:</span> I may have to change a few things, though with &quot;Total Validator&quot; (note to self: put in link), I can validate accessiblity for those with disabilities. While there are other changes/updates I want to make first, I do plan on making the site as acessible-friendly as possible, in my code</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span class="boldUnderline">December 7, 2013:</span> I have been doing major redo's of the software section pages (not the comments or descriptions ... yet)... I had planned on redoing them all and THEN uploading them all at once, though that seems to be taken too much of my free time. I will still change the layout, though I will upload the changes &quot;as I go&quot; and try to get them all done as soon as possible</p>
    <p>Please forgive the site's appearance. After a long period of neglect, I have decided to (while the content should mostly be the same), upgrade the program descriptions to sound much better, and to do an overall &quot;upgrade&quot; on the appearance. Hopefully viewers will agree that the changes will look better. Everything is being done &quot;when I have time&quot; so in otherwards, the changes are a work in progress. </p>
    <p>I am trying to strike a balance in the code of not removing all HTML related markup, in favor (or the way the standards seem to be headed).  of CSS as much as possible. I am going with CSS (sort of the style of the page such as color, font, font-size, margins, ..etc) for most things, as long as I do not break &quot;web standards&quot; while doing it.    </p>
    <p class="UpdateSummary">Firefox and Firefox Clone Comments    </p>
    <p><img src="progIcons/browsers/firefox_1.png" alt="Firefox Icon" width="36" height="36" class="imgleft" /></p>
    <p>After recently trying (still playing with it) Firefox 28.x Nightly with the new UN-customizable (at least the way Firefox has always been), I have to say that from first-hand experience, Firefox with the new Austrias (Chrome-like) Interface that's has been talked about on many tech sites and will be the new direction of Firefox in upcoming releases, that</p>
    <ol>
      <li>I don't think its as &quot;horrible&quot; as some make it out to be</li>
      <li>Having said that ... there are some major issues, ...
        <ul>
          <li> mainly involving removing items that have <span class="italics">(even pre-4.x Firefox's)</span> always been in the browser. The fact that you can NOT customize it the way you once did, is a bad move, if you ask me.          </li>
          <li> I have to say the &quot;Mozilla is trying to turn Firefox into Chrome from Google&quot; comments are NOT in-accurate from the appearance (Interface appearance as well as the idea of &quot;not being able to customize it anymore)    </li>
        </ul>

	<p>Starting to Change my site to a &quot;Christmas&quot; theme, as well as thinking about ways to change the layout, to make the site look more modern (not just color changes). </p>
    <p>My studies and free time (lack there of) is the real reason I have not kept this site updated more, though I am currently going through the sections and adding new programs and making the comments/descriptions better. <a href="security/securityIndex.php">(Right now the Media Player section is getting an update</a>)    </p>
    <p><span class="justify">NO real updates, lately. I have been VERY busy, and everytime I get any free time, I am   studying. Right now, I am really studying Circuitry Analysis   (in large part thanks to Mr. Jason Gibson of MathTutorDVD.com, as well   as various free videos on Youtube and free PDF tutorials), Differential Equations, as well as PSpice (appears to be a program that you can use FOR circuitry analysis. </span></p>

    <p class="justify"><span class="fiftyPercent"><img src="progIcons/media_players/5__winamp.png" alt="Winamp Icon" width="32" height="32" class="center" /></span>I have seen a great page on <a href="http://www.ghacks.net/2013/11/21/whats-best-winamp-alternative-now-shutting/" target="_blank">Winamp alternatives on Ghacks.net</a> since at the moment, AOL is shutting Winamp down. I do agree 100% with   the people who say &quot;Why not still use it if I like it and it works&quot;, and   to be honestly I have many of the alternatives listed on that page,   mainly so I can give my review of them on this site. </p>
    <p class="justify">I am not saying Winamp is bad to use or anyone who likes it   should STOP using it... nononono.. My intent is to give a review to give   a review of the other media players available and to &quot;just let people   know there are others out there&quot;.  My view as I said is &quot;IF you like   Winamp and it works fine for you... .why switch?&quot;</p>
    <p class="UpdateSummary">KeepPass Update<span class="updateDate">February 8, 2013</span></p>

<p class="justify"> Plan on adding a page on KeepPass, which is a password &quot;managing&quot; program that I had tried before and to be honest, didn't give as much time to as I should have. It is much better once I really started playing with it and fills a void with the lack of &quot;Good&quot; support for ROBOFORM, when changing browsers from Firefox. I have tested KeepPass with IE Clones (Maxthon, Avant, Slim Browser), Safari (though it is buggy with this browser), Opera, and Chromium and it seems to just work, though a small add-on may be needed (depending on the browser)</p>
