#### Cross Platform Addons

-	[**Social Fixer**](http://socialfixer.com/)

Allows right clicks and highlighting where forbidden by javascript

-	**StopAutoplay** 	

	This Plugin stops the auto playing of various files (Quicktime and real media for instance) ...

-	[**TidyFox**](http://www.tidyfox.com/)

	This adds (where you put it can be fully customized) button icon that gives you quick acesss, based on domians.

	I have tried a few "History in a sidebar" type addons and they weren't bad ... but they weren''t what I was looking for. This adds just enough of what I wanted, without being "in the way", if you ask me
