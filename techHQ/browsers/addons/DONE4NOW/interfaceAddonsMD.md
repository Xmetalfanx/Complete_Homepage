###Toolbar/Toolbar Related Addons and Menu Related Items </p>



		
-  ![HiCTitlebar Plus Icon](/techHQ/graphics/ffox/hideCaptionTitlebar_Plus_Icon.png)   [Hide Caption Titlebar Plus](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/13505/) 

	Allows for customizations of the Firefox 4 Menu Bar with a ton of options 

	The main purpose of this is that you can keep the &quot;Firefox 4&quot; menus and when you hover over that menu &quot;button, the regular menu bar
 expands to the right, so you can have &quot;the best of both&quot; types of menus.

	(FOR THE RECORD, Simply removing (on disabling this addon) and going to View ~~&gt; toolbar and checking &quot;Menu Bar&quot; will bring back the normal 
Toolbar that was there in 3.x and below)
             
                         
-  [Menu Editor](http://menueditor.mozdev.org/)

	Allows you to fully customize the menus (even context ... aka right click) menus of Firefox.

	I highly recommend using this when add-ons add too many menu items everywhere, and it seems like the interface is getting &quot;out of control&quot;
            
-  [More Tools Menu](http://code.google.com/p/more-tools-menu/) 

	Makes another &quot;More Tools Menu for add-ons, and only uses default &quot;Options, Add-ons, Downloads, ...etc&quot; in the Tools 
	menu to keep it more organized

-  [Organize Search Engines](http://firefox.maltekraus.de/extensions/organize-search-engines) 

	Allows you to organize the Search bar in Firefox, including adding folders and sorting existing entries in a variety of ways 

	For Example, I have a number of Sub-folders for search items, including &quot;
<span class="redtext">Search engine</span>s&quot;, &quot;<span class="redtext">Torrent Search sites</span>&quot; (to search them 
directly from the Firefox main GUI), and &quot;<span class="redtext">Misc</span>&quot; for all the search &quot;items&quot; that I want
 to keep that do not fit into either other category (IMDB, and weather.com, as well as Youtube, for example)

	This addon, (if you have alot of search bar items, that is) is very useful to keep things more organized
	
-  [Toolbar Buttons](http://codefisher.org/toolbar_button/) 
Adds many Toolbar Icons for various tasks that are not in Firefox by default

-  [UI Fixer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/258712/)
Change (or just allow FOR THE CHANGE) of a number of Interface items in Firefox 4 (and above)

-	[URL Fixer](http://www.chrisfinke.com/addons/url-fixer/)  

	Fixes commonly mis-typed web addresses such as:

	-  www.google.con
	-  www.youtube,com

-   [Vertical Toolbar](http://www.xuldev.org/verticaltoolbar/) 
Adds a vertical (on right or left side, you choose) Vertical toolbar to Firefox 

###Tab Related


- [Tab Utilies Icon](/techHQ/graphics/ffox/TabUtilities.png)  [**Tab Utilities  **](http://addons.mozilla.org/addon/59961)

Customize PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING AND ANYTHING related to tab 

Some things you can do with Tab Utilities is 

	-  Protect (from being accidently closed)
	- Duplicate (to a new tab) the current tab
	-  set font data for tabs:
    	  -  such as colors and background colors, bold, italics, underlining and more ... for various types of tabs (current, unread, ...etc)</li>

	I for some reason tried this years ago and after the 4.x upgrade where i had to reinstall everything (ALL my add-ons ... do to a new Firefox Profile) I never did reinstall this until 2 days ago ... I just wonder how I forgot about this one ... very very useful add-on 

					
-   ![tab mix plus icon](/techHQ/graphics/ffox/tabmixPlus.png)  [Tab Mix Plus](http://tmp.garyr.net)
		
	This and &quot;Tab Utilities&quot; are very similar. 

	Adds the functionality to Add text color and background color (as well as Bold, Italics...etc) to tabs to make them more distinguishable, as well as the &quot;menu&quot; that displays when you right-click a tab.. 

	There are MANY MORE features in this add-on, that I did not list here.

	NOTE: using both of these tab add-ons can cause functions in either to not work 100% properly. ... At least that has been by experience.</p></td>

-   [Tabs Menu](http://mikelward.com/software/firefox) 

	Adds a Menu, that shows the tabs that are open that you can select from. This is similar to &quot;Windows&quot; in many other Windows applications that  show currently open documents (say Libre Office, for example)


### Firefox
#### Address Bar/ Location Bar Related   

-  ![UI Enhancer Icons](/techHQ/graphics/ffox/UAEnhancer.png)  [UI Enhancer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ui-enhancer/)   

	Adds colorful &quot;breadcrumb&quot; layout to the Location (aka Address) Bar.

-	[Locationbar?](http://en.design-noir.de/mozilla/locationbar2/) 

	Adds Breadcrumb like layout that is highly customizable, though not as &quot;GUI-like&quot; or &quot;not as Flashy&quot; as UI Enhancer.
 
	In many cases that is better and is something users prefer.
