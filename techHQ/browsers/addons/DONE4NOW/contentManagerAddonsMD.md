- ![Aadvark Icon](/techHQ/graphics/ffox/aardvark.gif) [Aardvark](http://karmatics.com/aardvark/)

	A plug-in that allows for a point and click removal system of items on a web page, that allows for more efficient printing. (after all if your printing a web page ... you probably don't care about the ads and banners ... just the main content of the site)

	This Plug-in stops the auto playing of various files (Quicktime and real media for instance) ...
 
- <a href="http://www.tidyfox.com/">TidyFox</a>

	This adds (where you put it can be fully customized) button icon that gives you quick acesss, based on domians.
                
	I have tried a few &quot;History in a sidebar&quot; type addons and they weren't bad ... but they weren''t what I was looking for. This adds just enough of what I wanted, without being &quot;in the way&quot;, if you ask me

                
- [Social Fixer](http://SocialFixer.com) 

	Formerly &quot;Facebook Fixer&quot;'; This adds various extra features and enhancements to Facebook.
