- [ BarTab](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/67651)
	Allow you to control how tabs load (say when you click a link, or restore/restart Firefox after an addon installation) ..
	
    For example, if you have many tabs open, each tab will appear however, each page will not load until you select the tab you want and

- - [Memory Fox](http://www.browsermemory.com/)

	An addon to address the memory problem that exists in Firefox, where Firefox takes up more memory then it should.

	NOTE: Release by release, version by version, Firefox IS getting better handling memory and that is one of the items that Mozilla is said to be addresses

- - ![MAF ICon](/techHQ/graphics/ffox/MAF.png) [Mozilla Archive Format](http://maf.mozdev.org/)

    - Full Format (HTML + Images in a seperate folder (I think Firefox does this by default anyway
    - .MAFF - Single Files that contain the entire site and is based on ZIP compression

	I have no idea if this works, but it is supose to be a proxy that can over-ride regionally locked videos on youtube where you are not allow to view them solely based 
	on where you live.

	I guess this one is an &quot;if that happens to you&quot; this addon can help... otherwise you probably do not.

 - Normal Refresh
 - Refresh ONLY the images that haven't loaded, or haven't completely loaded yet
 - Reload the page, over-writing any existing cache of the site on your computer already 
          
 I have to say as simple as this sounds, this DOES come in handy sometimes when I only want to refresh say a few images on a page that did not load
