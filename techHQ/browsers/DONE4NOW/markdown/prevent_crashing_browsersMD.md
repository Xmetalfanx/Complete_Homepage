- Firefox - Alot of people love Firefox, alot of people hate it.. I am one of those who love it despite even I have had it freeze on me, recently. 

- Flock - This is based on Firefox 2.x (for now ... it has been said that when Firefox 3.x comes out in it's final version, Flock will make the Firefox 3.x improvements 
to the code in Flock as well) 
     
##Keys to firefox

- use a minimum amount of add-ons .. .. its tempting to add a ton of them, but eventually it will slow down firefox to the speed of ... well ... IE


####Firefox add-ons I do recommend to help improve user experiences across the web

- [Noscript ](http://noscript.net/)
   
	Blocks Javascript (with a whitelist for those that you want to allow), and some other malicious code that can auto &quot;run&quot; when you visit a website

- [Flashblock](http://flashblock.mozdev.org/)
	Like NoScript, it blocks Flash from auto playing ... may not make a difference for high speed internet users, but especially dialup users can benefits from this add-on. 
This of course also has a whitelist that can allow sites you know are ok and want to see the flash for.
        
- [CookieSafe](http://forum.softwareblaze.com/)
  Can manage cookies and block cookies coming from certain domains

- [Ublock](https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock)

	A very customizable and cross-browser ad and malware URL blocker
