				<p>Firefox - Alot of people love Firefox, alot of people hate it.. I am one of those who love it despite even I have had it freeze on me, recently. </p>

				<p>Flock - This is based on Firefox 2.x (for now … it has been said that when Firefox 3.x comes out in it’s final version, Flock will make the Firefox 3.x
				 improvements<br>to the code in Flock as well) </p>

				 Firefox add-ons I do recommend to help improve user experiences across the web</h4><ul>
			<li>
				<p><a href="http://noscript.net/">Noscript </a></p>
				<p>  Blocks Javascript (with a whitelist for those that you want to allow), and some other malicious code that can auto "run" when you visit a website</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><a href="http://flashblock.mozdev.org/">Flashblock</a><br>
			 Like NoScript, it blocks Flash from auto playing … may not make a difference for high speed internet users, but especially dialup users can benefits from
			  this add-on.<br>This of course also has a whitelist that can allow sites you know are ok and want to see the flash for.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><a href="http://forum.softwareblaze.com/">CookieSafe</a><br>Can manage cookies and block cookies coming from certain domains</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><a href="https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock">Ublock</a></p>
			<p>  A very customizable and cross-browser ad and malware URL blocker </p>
			</li>
			</ul>
