<p>This is the New Browers Section.</p>&#x9;

<p>This section will contain infomation on browser addons and what ones I find most useful to improve your webbrowsing experience.</p>&#x9;

<p>This will not just Firefox as it use to be on my site, but will also contain Opera, Chrom* (Chromium and Google Chrome) browser info as well as new browsers such as Vivadi</p>
