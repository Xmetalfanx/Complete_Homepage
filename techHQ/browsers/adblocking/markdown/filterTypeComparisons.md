### Static Filtering versus Dynamic Filtering

-	**Static filtering** is the filter that is done by the lists located in the Ublock dashboard under the  "3-party Filters"  tab 
	

-	**Dynamic filtering** 
	-	(only apparent when you put a checkmarks by "I am an advanced user" under the Settings tab in the Ublock Dashboard)

- This is a per-site filtering option that allows you to control individual domain request from different domains every-time you visit a site. 
		
	-	For those of you who just went cross-eyed, ... When you connect to a site ...say "www.siteA.com" there are usually more domains that just "SiteA.com" that connect.  
		
		These (while some are 100% associated and owned by the SiteA.com company), while other domains ARE considered third party items.  
		
	-	**What you can do with dynamic filtering can be explained with the following:**
			
		- You as a user, visits *http://www.siteA.com*.    
			 
			You may allow items from the domain *SiteA.com* (considered a first party domain since its the same as the URL/Link you are visiting), *SiteB.com*, though block everything else. 

			OF COURSE this can be adjusted by advanced user, as you visit the site, so if something "doesn't look right" on a site, you can allow/block domains, then refresh the page to reflect to those changes.
