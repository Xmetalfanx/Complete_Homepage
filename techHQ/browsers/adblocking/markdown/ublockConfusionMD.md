
## "Ublock" vs "Ublock Origin" confusion

#### Developers
-	Original Developer/Developer of "Ublock Origin" and  "Umatrix"
	-	[Raymond Hill - Github](https://github.com/gorhill)


- Developer Mr. Hill gave original project to, that (read below, I am not 100% SURE ON THIS) took the project though did not give Mr. Hill credit for the previous work at all.

	If any of this is wrong, I owe Mr. Aljoudi an appologie, though I am sure I got got whole mess sorted out now.

The way I understand it the original developer let the project go, to another developer.  

The ISSUE came when the new developer "acted" (again this is "the way I understand it") did not give any credit for the project to the original developer.

At some point, this "rubbed the original developer the wrong way" and (?? I do not know where the original developer forked his new project) and the ORIGINAL Ublock author started/continued "Ublock Origin"

-	(Original) Ublock ~~> Ublock Origins
	- "Fork" of Original Ublock ~~> Ublock
