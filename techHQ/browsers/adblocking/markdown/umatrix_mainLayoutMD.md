#Umatrix Layout 


###The top bar all the way on the left -
![Umatrix Global Rule](\techHQ\browsers\adblocking\screenshots\umatrix\globalRulesBlack.jpg)

 -   **Black** - Global rules for all the filters you see at that time, based on what domains are detected from the site your currently on (displayed down the left side ).
  -   Example - Many weather sites use "VirtualEarth" to display the topography on their maps.   If you want, you can go here allow all content from VirutalEarth to be Allowed, so you do not have to keep setting the on each (example) weather radar page.   
    

###The Main Layout - Spreadsheet Metaphor
Think of the the main layout like a spreadsheet.   

-	The Columns across the top are relations to the content (Cookies, CSS, Frames, Plugins,...etc ).  


-	The Rows down the left side (that will "populate" when you visit a page) reflect the domains from requests MADE BY that page your on 


-	Each "cell" (spreadsheet metaphor), has a top and bottom ... clicking the top will turn it green which means allow this content, while the bottom turns it red, which means block this content. 
	-	thinking like the Global Content Headers at the top (Cookies, CSS, Plugins, ...etc)  and the domain listed down the side (self explanatory) are like Column and Row Headers in a spreadsheet ... respectively*



### Two Types of Global Rules

--- 
#### Global filters based on DOMAIN 

![Domain-Site Rules](\techHQ\browsers\adblocking\screenshots\umatrix\siteRules_leftSide.jpg)

-  **Location:** The left hand side, going down...one column
	- Note: YOU CAN save your settings and even, back them up so if you use Firefox AND Opera, or Chrome, you can simple import your settings to the second browser.   
- **Explanation:** These are global settings based on the domain you click on in the list of domains on the left hand side

#### Global Filters based on CONTENT 
![Content Filters Across top](\techHQ\browsers\adblocking\screenshots\umatrix\topColumns.jpg)

- **Location:** The Bar across the top with "Cookies", "Plugins", "CSS", "Frames" ...etc 
- **Explanation:** These are global rules that (considering how all of these rules, interact of course) can let you manage the content in question block or all) globally.  That is across EVERY site/domain.
