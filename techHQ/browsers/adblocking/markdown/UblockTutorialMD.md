#### What is a Dynamic Filter?
A Dynamic filter is a more advanced filter than the regular static filter 

#### Global Dynamic Rules

Basically a *Global Dynamic Rule* is just a default rule that is a applied to any site you visit, without having to change the "allow/deny" settings all the time, if you know you always want to take the same action with that domain


#####Example of Global -vs- Per-site Dynamic Filtering 

*YOU CAN ADJUST dynamic filter settings to over-right the global settings, so if you (example) want to deny Facebook.com, on everything except "Facebook.com", you would set the global rule for Facebook.com do **deny** (red), and ON "Facebook.com" 's per-site dynamic filtering settings, you would set the dynamic filter for *Facebook.com*
