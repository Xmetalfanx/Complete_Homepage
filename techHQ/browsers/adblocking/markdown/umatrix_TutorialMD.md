### Example of how to use Global-vs-Per site filtering 
(note: Gorhill the developer of Ublock Origin AND UMatrix even uses this example on his site)
        
   - Set a global filter to BLOCK everything from Facebook.com
   
 - Then when you visit Facebook, under the BLUE   (see above) "FACEBOOK.COM",  you can allow "Facebook.com" content, simply ON Facebook.com  ONLY.
