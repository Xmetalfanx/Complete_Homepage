  .card-header Static filtering versus Dynamic Filtering 

  .card-text 
  ul
    li 
      div Static filtering is where the content is checked against a list of known ads/or whatever other type of content that "should be blocked".  You can think of this like the "default" for ad blockers. Not counting certain cases, you can remember that after the dynamic filters are applied (they take priority), the static filters ... at least by default, are still applied too.
    li 
      | A 
      span.font-italic Dynamic filter
      |  is a more advanced filter than the regular static filter found in blocklists that are used by Ublock of known ads/other content to block.  While not as advanced as some of the things (I see both as really useful and also "different animals" at times) you can do with Raymond Gorhill's other addon,
      span.font-italic Umatrix
      | ... this can give you finer control over how/what is blocked or allowed.

.card
  .card-header Do I need to use Dynamic Filtering?

  .card-text NO ... short answer ... NO ... it's more a thing "do you WANT to use it".  If the adblocker is on, it will still block things through the list files that can be updated automatically by default in Ublock Origin.  There is no reason to use dynamic filtering, if you do not want to.

h4 Dynamic filtering notes on Ublock Origin
div 1.  Dynamic filters overide static filters (the filter lists, used by adblockers).  So here you could hypothetically allow content on a "broken" (do to content being blocked) site WITHOUT turning off Ublock Origin all together.
div 2.  Since Static filters do not allow anything (If it's on the filterlist ... without any dynamic filtering figured in... .it's blocked ... if it's not on a filter list, it's allowed)..... there is no reason to get too confused here
div 3.  There is N00P to consider (I will get to that later), but that is something else that you can use to filter content, THOUGH you have to sort of thing ahead when you hear explanations.

  .card-header Ublock Origin Advanced mode - Global vs Local rules

  .card-text I admit I am not 100% sure I am using the right phrasing but a LOCAL rule so to speak is one for the site you currently on ... a GLOBAL rule effects all sites you visit. ....
    br/
    br/
    div For example
    ul
      li 
        | A 
        span.font-italic local rule
        | set for Facebook.com to allow all connections (green... again I will get to "noop filtering" later) WHILE YOU ARE ON Facebook.com would "Allow Facebook.com connections when you are on Facebook.com"
      
      li 
        | A 
        span.font-italic GLOBAL rule
        | could for instance Allow (Green) or Block (Red) Facebook.com connections NO MATTER the site you are on ... that is not saying there would be one ... but IF there is an attempt from Facebook.com, no matter the site, it could be allowed or blocked, based on what a user wants.

    td.pr-3.font-italics Description
    td Allows all connections from that domain, BYPASSING any static rules
    td BYPASSES dynamic filtering, but still apply any static list rules that may apply, if any do
    td Block the connection from this domain.  Static rules in a sense do not matter, the connection is just blocked anyway 

br/

div Remember you can set these things Globally (effects that domain's connection on all/any sites you visit), or locally (JUST the current website/domain you are currently on, for the domain that you are setting the rule for)

div Years ago I use to not understand Noop, and I would just set Dynamic Filters to Allow (Green), and now I think that was a bad idea ... well not "bad" ... but it's better to use Noop as it will ALLOW the connection, and only block it stuff if some ad/tracking list has that domain listed in it.
