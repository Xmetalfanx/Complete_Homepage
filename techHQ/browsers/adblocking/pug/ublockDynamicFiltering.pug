  .card-header What is Static filtering?

  .card-text Static filtering is where the content is checked against a list of known ads/or whatever other type of content that "should be blocked".  You can think of this like the "default" for ad blockers.



h3 What is a Dynamic Filtering?
div A
span.font-italic Dynamic filter
| is a more advanced filter than the regular static filter found in blocklists that are used by Ublock of known ads/other content to block.  While not as advanced as some of the things (I see both as really useful and also "different animals" at times) you can do with Raymond Gorhill's other addon,
span.font-italic Umatrix
| ... this can give you finer control over how/what is blocked or allowed.

  .card-header Do I need to use Dynamic Filtering?

  .card-text NO ... short answer ... NO ... it's more a thing "do you WANT to use it".  If the adblocker is on, it will still block things through the list files that can be updated automatically by default in Ublock Origin.  There is no reason to use dynamic filtering, if you do not want to.

h4 Dynamic filtering notes on Ublock Origin
div 1.  Dynamic filters overide static filters (the filter lists, used by adblockers).  So here you could hypothetically allow content on a "broken" (do to content being blocked) site WITHOUT turning off Ublock Origin all together.
div 2.  Since Static filters do not allow anything (If it's on the filterlist ... without any dynamic filtering figured in... .it's blocked ... if it's not on a filter list, it's allowed)..... there is no reason to get too confused here
div 3.  There is N00P to consider (I will get to that later), but that is something else that you can use to filter content, THOUGH you have to sort of thing ahead when you hear explanations.

  .card-header Ublock Origin Advanced mode - Global vs Local rules

  .card-text

    div I admit I am not 100% sure I am using the right phrasing but a LOCAL rule so to speak is one for the site you currently on ... a GLOBAL rule effects all sites you visit. .... For example 
    ul
      li A local rule set for Facebook.com to allow all connections (green... again I will get to "noop filtering" later) WHILE YOU ARE ON Facebook.com would "Allow Facebook.com connections when you are on Facebook.com"
      li A GLOBAL rule could for instance Allow (Green) or Block (Red) Facebook.com connections NO MATTER the site you are on ... that is not saying there would be one ... but IF there is an attempt from Facebook.com, no matter the site, it could be allowed or blocked, based on what a user wants.
