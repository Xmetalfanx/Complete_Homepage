      | This is a per-site filtering option that allows you to control individual domain request from different domains
      | every-time you visit a site.

        p
          | For those of you who just went cross-eyed, ... When you connect to a site ...say &quot;www.siteA.com&quot; there are
          | usually more domains that just &quot;SiteA.com&quot; that connect.
        | &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;
        p
          | These (while some are 100% associated and owned by the SiteA.com company), while other domains ARE considered third
          | party items.
      | &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;
      li

          strong What you can do with dynamic filtering can be explained with the following:
        | &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;
        ul
          li
            p
              | You as a user, visits
              em http://www.siteA.com
              | .
            | &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;
            p
              | You may allow items from the domain
              em SiteA.com
              |  (considered a first party domain since its the same as the URL/Link you are visiting),
              | &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;
              em SiteB.com
              | , though block everything else.
            | &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;
            p
              | OF COURSE this can be adjusted by advanced user, as you visit the site, so if something &quot;doesn&apos;t look
              | right&quot; on a site, you can allow/block domains, then refresh the page to reflect to those changes.
