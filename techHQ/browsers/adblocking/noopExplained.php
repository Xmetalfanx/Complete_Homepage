<h3>Noop Filters </h3>

<p>What happens is when you set a domain to <span class="green"> <em>Allow</em> (Green) </span>, it will bypass the static (filter-list) filters.  (Found in the "3rd Party Filter" section of Ublock Origin's Dashboard)
</p>

<p>What the NOOP filter does is it allow the item from the domain you set the <em>Noop</em> filter (grey/black) on, THOUGH UNLIKE <em>Allow</em> it STILL APPLIES, the static (3rd party) filters. </p>

<p>I can say, that using <em>Allow</em> instead of <em>Noop</em> has not been an issue for me, though I think i would still have used Noop before, as I had been making a mistake with my logic vs the way Ublock filters, since I started using it.</p>

<h5>My Mistake</h5>
<ul>
	<li>NOTE: THIS IS WRONG </li>
</ul>

<p>I was under the under the impression <span class="green"> <em>Allow</em> (Green) </span> would of course allow the content from that domain, though the static filters were still applied <em>to that content</em>.  This would mean, if something from an <em>allowed domain</em> gets &quot;flagged&quot; in one of the 3rd party blocklists, then just that flagged element would be blocked, but the rest of the content, would be allowed... IF I AM UNDERSTAND THIS RIGHT ... </p>

<p>THAT is how NOOP RULES work... no matter what is in the static blocklists, the content that got flagged (in my example) would still be display/sen
