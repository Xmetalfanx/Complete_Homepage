h3 Static Filtering versus Dynamic Filtering
ul

    p
      strong Static filtering
      |  is the filter that is done by the lists located in the Ublock dashboard under the
      | &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&quot;3-party Filters&quot; tab
  | &#x9;
  li
    p
      strong Dynamic filtering
    | &#x9;&#x9;
    ul
      li
        | (only apparent when you put a checkmarks by &quot;I am an advanced user&quot; under the Settings tab in the Ublock
        | Dashboard)
    | &#x9;&#x9;

  | &#x9;
  li
    p
      | This is a per-site filtering option that allows you to control individual domain request from different domains
      | every-time you visit a site.
    | &#x9;&#x9;
    ul
      li
        p
          | For those of you who just went cross-eyed, ... When you connect to a site ...say &quot;www.siteA.com&quot; there are
          | usually more domains that just &quot;SiteA.com&quot; that connect.
        | &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;
        p
          | These (while some are 100% associated and owned by the SiteA.com company), while other domains ARE considered third
          | party items.
      | &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;
      li
        p
          strong What you can do with dynamic filtering can be explained with the following:
        | &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;
        ul
          li
            p
              | You as a user, visits
              em http://www.siteA.com
              | .
            | &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;
            p
              | You may allow items from the domain
              em SiteA.com
              |  (considered a first party domain since its the same as the URL/Link you are visiting),
              | &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;
              em SiteB.com
              | , though block everything else.
            | &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;
            p
              | OF COURSE this can be adjusted by advanced user, as you visit the site, so if something &quot;doesn&apos;t look
              | right&quot; on a site, you can allow/block domains, then refresh the page to reflect to those changes.

h4 What is a Dynamic Filter?
p A Dynamic filter is a more advanced filter than the regular static filter

h4 Global Dynamic Rules
p
  | Basically a
  em Global Dynamic Rule
  |  is just a default rule that is a applied to any site you visit, without having to change the
  | &#x9;&#x9;&quot;allow/deny&quot; settings all the time, if you know you always want to take the same action with that domain
| &#x9;
h5 Example of Global -vs- Per-site Dynamic Filtering
| &#x9;
p
  | *YOU CAN ADJUST dynamic filter settings to over-right the global settings, so if you (example) want to deny Facebook.com, on
  | everything except &quot;Facebook.com&quot;, you would set the global rule for Facebook.com do
  strong deny
  |  (red), and ON &quot;Facebook.com&quot; &apos;s per-site dynamic filtering settings, you would set the
  | &#x9;&#x9;dynamic filter for
  | &#x9;&#x9;
  em Facebook.com
