	strong REMEMBER
	| : A common error when backing up data new users make is backing items up the same drive and not actually using removable media... in this sense you put your spare house keys on the same keychain as the originals, so if you do manage to lose one... you lose the other one too .... (If you are using separate partitions, that would work too ... but still ... if your Hard drive goes down... all partitions will be lost too)
