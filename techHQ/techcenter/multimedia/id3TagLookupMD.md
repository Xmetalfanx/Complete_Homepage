&quot;Id3 tag lookups are useless... the information they retrieve has nothing to do with the band, much less the song I am looking up&quot; ... that honestly sounds very familiar ....In certain cases I have said the same thing. I have found a few program that do a pretty good job at retrieving the information you need to complete these tags.

*Notes to remember before we continue here *

- If the artist(s) is rare, there is a good chance that you will not &quot;auto&quot; lookup the tag no matter what software you use...It may be worth a try. though

  - (the same as above) , with a popular artist, but the song itself is rare or a &quot;live track&quot;... you may have difficulty finding the correct information in auto tag lookups


##Freeware Auto ID3 Tag Lookup options that I have tried


- Winamp (with Gracenote plugin)

    yes, i know the pro and cons of this one are ... the same)

- **Pros:** Good job retrieving the correct information

- **Cons:** not as accurate as I'd like it to be.... in SOME cases, a popular artist + a popular song = odd results that are not accurate
