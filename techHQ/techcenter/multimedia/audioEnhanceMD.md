  DFX is a shareware and a well known plugin that I use and fine that combined with setting the default Winamp equalizer, can make your audio sound very rich, from the tremble to the bass. It can also remove the &quot;muffled&quot; sound that comes when you compress the audio (say making and mp3 from a CD), add Ambience, which will  &quot; compensates for the lost or diminished stereo depth that is the result of closely located speakers, poor listening environments, and sonic losses due to data compression of Internet audio formats&quot; (from DFX Help File), as well as add a 3D effect to your music. DFX has a plugin for all of the &quot;main&quot; Players except for Quintessential (QCD) Player. </p>

			</a>I have personally tried many of the other plugins, especially 
              for Winamp and found that of the other shareware DSP Plugins are 
              very bad at what they say they do. DFX is a definite exception to 
              that. </p>

            <p class="justify">iZotope Ozone is the result of an extensive research effort to separate the good from the bad of analog and model the desirable aspects. As a plug-in for Winamp, iZotope Ozone offers all the 
				convenience of digital storage combined with the sound quality of vintage analog equipment. <span class="mainSiteUpdates">(*from Ozone for Winamp Help file*)</span></p>
            <p><strong>My personal note</strong>: this is a plugin that when used with the right presets <span class="mainSiteUpdates">*,
                it can make the audio sound even better then the DFX plugin can,
                and that is another great Winamp plugin </span></p>
            <p><span class="mainSiteUpdates">*(on
                    a good mp3 of course... if its a poorly encoded mp3 ... there
            is only so much a plugin can actually do)</span></p>

            <ul>
              <li>&quot;Cleanup Mp3&quot; will get rid of any un-recognizable 
                information in the header of the mp3. (similar to what Jpg Cleaner, 
                cleans in Jpgs)<br /></li>
              <li>Remove the last frame of any mp3 that 
                have corrupt headers.<br />
              </li>
              <li>Fixes missing/corrupt CRC information.              
                <ul>
                  <li>S<span class="justify">Software Players such as Winamp are good in over-looking
                    this problem; however, hardware players (Rio Volts, &quot;Hard Drive 
                  Players&quot;). Audio Editing Programs such as Cool Edit (and
                  CE Pro) have problems reading Mp3s with CRC errors.</span><br />
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li> <em>Auto Trim</em> -
                <ul>
                  <li>Trims of Excess Silence of Mp3s before 
                      the start of the track, and after the end.<br />
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><span class="justify"> The ability to add fades to Auto-Trim that will fade in (to 
                what the user selects). This will prevent any harsh ends to short 
                tracks, the music will fade out or fade in accordingly. </span><br />
              </li>
              <li class="justify">Volume Controls that will increase of decrease a track in decibels. 
                DON'T WORRY that it will get too loud (if you click &quot;auto&quot; 
                that is). it detects how much it should increase. I have found 
                this to be the fix to many problems i had with my RIO Volt (actually 
                its the mp3s, and not the Rio Volt's Problem). One Mp3 is loud, 
                while the next is soft, I would put the volume up louder, then 
                the next track, is super loud.<br />
                <p> This feature I would use on any recorded (from say a Cassette) 
                  track. It can be VERY useful</p>
