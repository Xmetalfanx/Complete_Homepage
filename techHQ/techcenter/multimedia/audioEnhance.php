              is a shareware and a well known plugin that I use and fine that 
              combined with setting the default Winamp equalizer, can make your 
              audio sound very rich, from the tremble to the bass. It can also 
              remove the &quot;muffled&quot; sound that comes when you compress 
              the audio (say making and mp3 from a CD), add Ambience, which will 
              &quot; compensates for the lost or diminished stereo depth that 
              is the result of closely located speakers, poor listening environments, 
              and sonic losses due to data compression of Internet audio formats&quot; 
              (from DFX Help File), as well as add a 3D effect to your music. 
              DFX has a plugin for all of the &quot;main&quot; Players except 
              for Quintessential (QCD) Player. </p>

			</a>I have personally tried many of the other plugins, especially 
              for Winamp and found that of the other shareware DSP Plugins are 
              very bad at what they say they do. DFX is a definite exception to 
              that. </p>

            <p class="justify">iZotope Ozone is the result of an extensive research effort to separate the good from the bad of analog and model the desirable aspects. As a plug-in for Winamp, iZotope Ozone offers all the

            <p><strong>My personal note</strong>: this is a plugin that when used with the right presets 
            <span class="mainSiteUpdates">*,
                it can make the audio sound even better then the DFX plugin can,
                and that is another great Winamp plugin </span></p>

                that is). it detects how much it should increase. I have found 
                this to be the fix to many problems i had with my RIO Volt (actually 
                its the mp3s, and not the Rio Volt's Problem). One Mp3 is loud, 
                while the next is soft, I would put the volume up louder, then 
                the next track, is super loud.<br />
                <p> This feature I would use on any recorded (from say a Cassette) 
                  track. It can be VERY useful</p>
