Optimizing Audio is something that some people don't even think about. They just download music from the internet and assume that, that is the best it could be. Like Graphics taken from digital cameras, when recording audio, you want it to sound the best it can and then do editing. If the Camera is really bad (or in this case the audio) connection is &quot;bad&quot;, audio editing can only help so much. It can help the audio you recorded... not perform miracles </p>

A good program I have found for mp3s is [Mp3 Trim Pro](http://www.logiccell.com/%7Emp3trim/).  Many times I have found when making an Mp3 CD, that the volume varies so that I have to turn the volume way up on one song, and then next song is way too loud when playing. Mp3Trip Pro can
             <a href="../faq/Record/gettingStarted.php" target="_blank">normalize</a> 
                (many freeware programs can do this, as such as audio editors, such as the one contained in 
                Nero&#39;s cd-burning software). This can bring volumes of tracks with low volumes up to a
                certain level, and lower volumes of tracks with high volume audio down to the same level. </p>
       
Mp3 Trim Pro can also eliminate long bits of silence before or after audio in the mp3. This usually happens when recording audio where you press the record button before the play, creating  extra space in the track before the audio begins and ends. </p>

##Media Players
       
  Most Audio Playing programs can handle errors in the header of an mp3. One of the best players, Winamp, Does not seem to have any problems reading these files; however, I have heard of some Mp3 
Hard drives (portable mp3 players then can store perhaps thousands of mp3s.... really expensive from what I remember reading about them awhile back...) Normalizing an audio track will lower the levels of tracks that   have volumes too high (those stereos at Best Buy or Circuit City, where when they hit even 1/2 as loud as the total level is, the audio quality seems to go &quot;south&quot; really fast). On the other hand it can also  raise the level of audio tracks recorded that are too low. Remember, Normalizing will adjust the level of  the volume.... it has nothing to do with the improving of audio Quality itself </p>
      
Some media Players seem very very slow while opening files. Between the time it takes for the them to load, and sometimes skipping, some media playing programs can be a real plan. I have found that a consistently  good player is [Winamp](http://www.winamp.com). There are betas of the new 5.x version out, which i am using right now. 

But if you don't feel comfortable with betas get 3.x or 2.x.... 3.x get &quot;trash talked&quot; alot but in my  opinion Winamp 3 is STILL better then any other player except for Winamp 2 and the betas of Winamp 5..... all others like Real One, Musicmatch, Windows Media Player, Sonique, QCD.... all don't compare.</p>
