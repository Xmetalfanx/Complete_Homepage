  <p>This is a short (hopefully) guide with the tips I list to the left, all in one location. This would be the steps I would take (assuming its not infected with
   Malware or a Virus and that is the cause of the slowdown) to optimize a computer.  I am not going to list every program that can perform a task, but just
   the &quot;top&quot; choice I would use.... for more options, see the sub pages from the menus to the left in this Maintenance Section. I want to say this
   again, this is assuming your machine is infection free... otherwise checking for Malware/Virus infection's would be #1 and #2 on the follow list.
   All program (unless noted) are Open Source or Freeware.   </p>

  <p class="header">Are any of those &quot;Fix-it with One Click&quot; programs worth using?  </p>
  <p>Yes, though I am not a fan of all of them. These program I recommend help you perform numerous maintenance tasks all at once   </p>
  <p>These are not &quot;Miracle&quot; programs that will make your system run &quot;100% better&quot; , remove infections, ...etc etc.
  These CAN (especially if no maintenance has ever been done on your system) help improve system performance.  </p>

  <p>What I am saying is these will not make your computer act like it's twice as powerful or fast (that is where RAM/Memory and  Processor Speed
  comes in).   </p>

  <p>If these programs do &quot;Make your computer 100% faster&quot; than that is how well your computer should have been in the
  first place. (although you may not have known it). I have even seen newly bought computers bogged down with so many trials programs and
  other &quot;offers&quot; it's &quot;not even funny&quot;

  <p class="redtext">Programs I trust for One-Click Maintenance:

  <ul>
    <li>
    <a href="http://www.glarysoft.com/" target="_blank">
      <img src="../progIcons/system_tools/Gary4.png" alt="Glary Utilities 4 icon" width="64" height="64" class="iconsLeft" />Glary Utilities (FREE)</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Some of the tasks this program can perform, are: Invalid Shortcut Fixer/Remover, Temp File Remover (scans whole HDD),
      Trace remover, Registry Cleaner, Start-up Manager, and most useful a new user (if you ask me) a 1-Click Maintenance feature that
      performs selected tasks automatically for the user. <br /> <br /> </li>
    </ul>

      JV16 Power Tools</a> (Shareware) or JV16 Power Tools Lite (Freeware)
    <ul>
      <li>Though its not free, its one of my favorites   </li>

    <ul>
      <li> I don't use this one as you can get most (maybe not all) of the tools in this program, individually for free from the site. Auslogic has many freewares, though this one has a few extras I do not think they offer for free (Say the Disk Checker/Checkdisk program). Others such as the Disk Defrag, Disk Cleaner, and Registry Cleaner are just examples of the 100% free programs they offer, that are &quot;combined&quot; in this program
      </li>
      <li>&quot;System Adviser&quot; is similar to &quot;
      <a href="#systemTune">System Tuneup</a>&quot; (link to description below) in Wise Registry Cleaner. and it may contain different suggestions, though PLEASE READ before you tweak ... the adjustments are EASY to undo/&quot;Restore&quot; though its a good idea to read what your adjusting before you just go changing things.

      </li>
      <li>After you have an idea of what your startup programs do, with this step you can spot odd (say an infection starting at every boot up) easier, without the need for other software. I have personally spotted &quot;odd&quot; EXE files running on different computers before and without even running a scan, I knew those files were probably infections
      </li>
      <li>*** NOT EVERY PROGRAM YOU MAY NOT KNOW IS AN INFECTION ** ... many programs have &quot;auto start when Windows boots up&quot; on by default and going into the program's settings and un-checking &quot;one box&quot; is a solution to this.

I was about to free up about 12 to 15 GB (Yes Gigabytes) of data .... for those that do not know ... if you bought a pack of DVDs in the stores (4.7GB) you would almost need 3 to 4 DVDs to contain the data that was removed.

To not drive yourself crazy running these programs back to back to back (..etc )... they may &quot;defrag in different ways&quot; though they both are good.  There are other decent choices out there (many free)... these are just two of my favorite.

      <li>The fact that, you do NOT need to do this step often, unless you install and un-install many programs, I do agree with.
      </li>
      <li>Like Disk Defragmenting, you do not have to &quot;go crazy&quot; doing this every day, every other day, or in some cases, every week; though its a good idea to run one of these from time to time. All of these I have used without any ill-effects. I have not run benchmarks to say &quot;program A is better than program B&quot; .. many of these are similar and I am just giving a few options

          <li> Decent but basic registry cleaner... nothing comprehensive about it, though many people have this program for it's Temp File and Cache/Cookie Cleaning functions, anyway.

          <li>This is along the lines of Auslogic's Registry Cleaner or the Registry Cleaner found in Glary Utilities
          </li>
          <li>
          <a name="systemTune" id="systemTune"></a>The reason this program stands out to me is the &quot;System Tune-up&quot; feature which disables many options/features that may be making your computer run slower than it can be. I have tried this on both of my computers and though I have not noticed any &quot;great speed improvements&quot;, it HAS NOT harmed either machine either. .. Results (on how well it may help, that is) may very
          </li>
          <li>This program also has a registry &quot;Defragmenter&quot; built in<br />                    <br />

      <li>If there is one step I list here you should probably do THE LEAST, This may be it. I would only advice to do this step AFTER a registry cleaning.
      <ul>
        <li>A Metaphor that comes to mind for doing a Registry Defrag before a registry Cleaning, is waxing a car before you wash it. It doesn't hurt anything (I do not think) ... though it is just logical to get rid of un-needed entries THAN defragment it.
        </li>
        <li>This SAME logic can be used for using a &quot;Temp File/Folder Cleaner&quot; before a Disk Defragmenter.

  <p class="header">Summary
  </p>
  <p>This is basically it.  Like I said not all of these have to be done frequently, and though I am a fan of &quot;playing around... thats how you learn&quot;... If you are truly not comfortable doing a particular task I list, .... DO NOT do it.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Just because I may not list a program here, does not mean it's not any good. I am finding good new programs all the time.
    </li>
    <li>I would like you to notice that the same programs appear many times in different sections
    <ul>
      <li>Say
      <span class="redtext">CCleaner
      </span>, and
      <span class="redtext">Glary Utilities
      </span> can be downloaded and used for multiple different steps (that I list above) ...
      <ul>
        <li>Though (example)- CCleaner's Registry Cleaner is not as comprehensive as some of the other choices. it does work
        </li>
        <li>I say this due to some people feeling &quot;overwhelmed&quot; with program suggestion by myself and others on the web. There is not necessarily a reason to have &quot;hundreds&quot; of programs to help your computer.
        </li>
      </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you perform a few maintenance tasks, your computer will be much friendlier to work with.
