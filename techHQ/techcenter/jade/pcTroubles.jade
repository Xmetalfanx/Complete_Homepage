        | The 
        span. Two best Scanners
        |  (as mentioned many places on my site here) are
        |         
        a(href='http://www.kaspersky.com') Kaspersky Antivirus 
        | or
        |         
        a(href='http://www.bitdefender.com', target='_blank') Bit Defender
      |

        | The rest (not necessarily all of them though, tend to be &quot;patchy&quot; in how good their detection actually
        | is
      |         
      li Mcafee and Norton in my option are the two worst
      |         
      li
        | Some people swear by their anti-trojan scanners too (
        a(href='http://www.moosoft.com', target='_blank')
          | The Cleaner
        | , for instance), but any virus scanner worth anything if you ask me, will detect
        | &#x9;&#x9; most trojans or worms
