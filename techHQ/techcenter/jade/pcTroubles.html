<p>Things to check when, your system seems to be acting strange. (In order ... somewhat... but not necessarily)</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <u>Check for Viruses/Trojans/Worms</u>      
    <ul>
      <li>The <span></span> (as mentioned many places on my site here) are
                <a href="http://www.kaspersky.com">Kaspersky Antivirus </a>or
                <a href="http://www.bitdefender.com" target="_blank">Bit Defender</a>
      </li>        
      <li>
        The rest (not necessarily all of them though, tend to be &quot;patchy&quot; in how good their detection actually
        is
      </li>        
      <li>Mcafee and Norton in my option are the two worst</li>        
      <li>Some people swear by their anti-trojan scanners too (<a href="http://www.moosoft.com" target="_blank">The Cleaner</a>, for instance), but any virus scanner worth anything if you ask me, will detect
        &#x9;&#x9; most trojans or worms 
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
