      <p>Things to check when, your system seems to be acting strange. (In order ... somewhat... but not necessarily) </p>
      <ol>
        <li><u>Check for Viruses/Trojans/Worms
          </u>
          <ul>
            <li>The <span class="interestsTitles">Two best Scanners</span> (as mentioned many places on my site here) are 
            <a href="http://www.kaspersky.com">Kaspersky Antivirus </a>or 
            <a href="http://www.bitdefender.com" target="_blank">Bit Defender</a></li>
            <li>The rest (not necessarily all of them though, tend to be &quot;patchy&quot; in how good their detection actually 
            is</li>
            
            <li>Mcafee and Norton in my option are the two worst</li>
            <li>Some people swear by their anti-trojan scanners too (<a href="http://www.moosoft.com" target="_blank">
				The Cleaner</a>, for instance), but any virus scanner worth anything if you ask me, will detect
				 most trojans or worms too, if fully updated</li>
            <li>AVAST and AVG (two freeware scanners ... although there may be more ..) 
            <span class="boldItalics">ARE IN FACT</span> better options for background scanning and detection overall ... then Mcafee or Norton.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><u>Check for <a href="../graphics/programs/browsers/getFirefox.gif">Spyware</a>.</u>
          <ol>
            <li>Like Antiviruses, not all spyware scanners are the same ... </li>
            <li>Microsoft Bought out &quot;Giant Antispyware&quot;  and it was great at the start, but now (now called &quot;Microsoft LiveOne&quot;... i think) it is not that good </li>
            <li>The only non-free spyware scanner I like is Spy Sweeper from Webroots.com</li>
            <li>The rest are Spyware Blaster, Spybot, Hijackthis, CWShredder, and/or Adaware (free edition) </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
