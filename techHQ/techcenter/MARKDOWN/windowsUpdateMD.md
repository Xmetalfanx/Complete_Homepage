**<a name="m1" id="m1"></a>Method 1**

##What you need

- 	<a href="http://www.getfirefox.com" target="_blank">Firefox</a> (a web browser alternative to IE ... for those that do not already know)
-	<a href="http://windowsupdate.62nds.com/" target="_blank">WindizUpdate Plugin / Addon</a>
      
  
###What to do? 
 
- Once you have Firefox Installed, 
- go to the Windiz Website above and install the plugin. (note: you may need to specifically allow that site to be able to install plugins) ...
- Run &quot;Scan my Computer&quot; like you would on Microsoft's Update. 
- INSTALLING THE UPDATES

   1. 	First you may (Like MS's) just let the updater do everything ... download and install ... ) which is perfectly fine</li>
   2. 	This site also allows you to (in an easier manner) download them and install them later.... they are located in the 
        <span class="redtext">C:|WUTEMP</span> folder 
        
     **Comments:** What this does is basically the same as Microsoft, but for those who don't like MS scanning their system OR have problems with Microsoft's Website. 
     I do currently have my AutoUpdate/Automatic update( ..whatever) Service in XP set at DISABLED. I know you have to turn on two of the services to even get MS's 
     scanner to work. 
          
     <p class="mainProgDescript">Note: i am not sure if this is &quot;XP Only&quot; at the moment. ... not saying it is or it isn't </p>

###Method 2
      
####What you Need?

<a href="http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html" target="_blank"> Belarc Adviser</a> -
is a tool that scans various areas in your system and then tell you what programs you have installed, what some of the &quot;basic&quot; and &quot;no so basic&quot; hardware info about your computer is AND according to the latest Security bulletin (I THINK its the latest at the time the last version of Belarc was released .. . ) what Windows updates and/or hotfixes your system is missing, it also may find problem updates that &quot;need to be reinstalled&quot; ... this is a GREAT TOOL if you ask me

####What to do?
  
1.	Just run Belarc by clicking the Belarc Icon on your Start Menu OR Desktop 
2.	Your Browser will open with &quot;Profile&quot; of your PC and look for where it says <span class="redtext">System Security Scanner</span> and look at where it says 
    <span class="redtext">&quot;Microsoft Security Updates&quot;</span> (This screenshot was taken from a PC with all patches, but you may have a red X and a message
                          like &quot;3 patches/hotfixes missing) 
    
    - 	<img src="UPDATE/SSS.jpg" alt="Belarc Summary Screenshot" width="518" height="76" />

        
3.	when you Click that it will take you down the page and list the patches you need in a link for to Microsoft</li>
4.	go to the MS link and download the patches manually or go to a site like <a href="http://windowsupdate.62nds.com/" target="_blank">WindizUpdate Plugin / 
Addon</a> (Listed above) and go to the &quot;search&quot; menu on the left ... copy and paste the patch you need (AKA &quot;<span class="redtext">Q22423</span>&quot;) 
into that and manually get the exe of the patch from <a href="http://windowsupdate.62nds.com/" target="_blank">WindizUpdate Plugin / Addon</a> ... this way you can back 
those exe's up onto a CD-R and install them in other computers or just plain know what updates you need if you reformat so that you do not have to waste a ton of time 
re-downloading the updates you previously had already :D </li>
