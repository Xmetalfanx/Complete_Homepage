Along with the number of run-away system log entries, I have noticed on a few machines a ton of restore points that are no longer needed. I am not going into my  
view of restore points and how people mess up while using them (like getting a virus, then restoring thier computer ... to an earlier point ... when they were STILL 
 INFECTED&quot;....

### HERE IS A SIMPLE WAY TO CLEAN OUT SOME UN-NEED ENTRIES.

All you need is one program that I have already mentioned many times on my site 

    <a href="http://www.ccleaner.com" target="_blank">         
      <img src="/techHQ/progIcons/security/cleaners/959__CCv2.gif" alt="CCleaner Icon" width="32" height="32" class="imgleft" /> CCleaner </a>

1 .  Open CCleaner and go to the &quot;Tools&quot; Panel (look on the left, under &quot;Cleaner&quot; and &quot;Registry&quot; 
2.  from here Click &quot;Restore points&quot; 
3.  From here what and how many you remove is up to you. Especially on computers that are not mine, I ususally leave a few of them, but I have seen over 10 to 
15 entries.    After I clear them out I have noticed a difference of 15 GB (yes GB ) after clearing some of the older entries out.

be one entry in the list and not the many I am saying. ALSO, I am 99% sure that CCleaner does NOT TOUCH the most recent restore point, so even if you want 
Ccleaner to remove it
