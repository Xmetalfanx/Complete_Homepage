   For Opening Video or Audio Files to see what codec you may need to open it (useful if you can not open a particular Media File

###Video Files 
Video Codecs for file types of AVIs can be &quot;touchy&quot;
     
- AVI, MOV, MPG, MPEG</li>
     

Files can be converted but have to stay in the same type. There are some OBVIOUS mistakes some new users have when converting ... </p>

&quot;Oh ... this was suppose to be an Mp3 file but its a .RAR file

####Exceptions to the rule 

-	Text to Mp3 by using a TTS (Text to Speech Program)</li>
-	&quot;Ripping&quot; Audio out of a video file to record to say an Mp3</li>
       
-	FILE EXTENSION RENAMING 
       
   -	<span class="mainSiteUpdates">(NOTE: you have to have &quot;show all file extensions for known data types&quot; checked in File Options in &quot;Windows Explorer&quot; 
   or you'll run into the double extension problem ... THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER TOPIC ... ) </span></li>
   
   -	This is basically where a website will have a 5MB .txt file and then you rename the file (based on the instructions on a particular site that may not allow 
        the webmaster to put up .mp3 files) from Songname.txt to Songname.mp3... technically though .. this is not converting text to mp3
