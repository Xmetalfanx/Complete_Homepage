 Supposedly gets some of the LSO persistent Cookies in various locations that some other programs (at the time I am typing this) can not.   
 Bleachbit is a  good option and I recommend it completely

This little app is for CCleaner and adding many more programs to it's &quot;Database&quot; ... It doesn't remove anything (CCleaner) unless you TELL IT 
to.  ... you run this from time to time updating like a malware or antivirus scanner

This program is a little tool I have always seen, but I was never sure if it worked... Turns out it does, and works great tool. Might be one of my Must have  programs
very soon. 
    

This will clean your Browser Cache, temp files, cookies (Opera, Mozilla (suite), Firefox, and IE), among MANY MRU settings for common programs.

This Program is  a highly configurable and FREE file wiper. This can do both simple for new users, and complicated wipes, that experts can customize  to their liking ... 
         
***One of my Must Haves***

NOTE: I have had alot of issues with the new &quot;upgrade&quot; 6.x branch and do not care for it... My liking is for the old 5.x branch by the
ORIGINAL developer. I am not trashing the new group working on Eraser... just stating that it really needs work.. Doing basic tasks I have done for 
years crashes, Eraser 6 (folder wiping, filing wiping ...etc) right &quot;ot of the gate&quot;

Good Program ... only reason I do not use it much is that Bleachbit and/or CCLeaner gets the same thing   this program does, but its a good interface
and worth a look, for sure


This is the sort of program that you should run alot if you ask me (if you dont use the computer for a few days, than you dont need to run in then)... 
  I run CCleaner everytime i get off the internet, as it should only take aboue 15 seconds (at MOST) ...and Cleanup from time to time.
