This is something that you really dont have to do alot but if your computer is running sluggish, and its been a LONG time since you formatted or reinstalled a 
new version of Windows, you may want to give this a try AGAIN, I have run into issues with NON-&quot;


### Some Programs who's "Registry Defrag" or "Registry Compactors" that I trust



- ![](/techHQ/progIcons/system_tools/glary.png)  [Glary Utilities](http://www.glarysoft.com/)  

(FREE or Pro available, though I use the very powerful free version)           

Some of the tasks this program can perform, are: Invalid Shortcut Fixer/Remover, Temp File Remover (scans whole HDD), Trace remover, Registry Cleaner, Start-up Manager,
Registry Defragmenter, and most useful a new user (if you ask me) a 1-Click Maintenance feature that performs selected tasks automatically for the user.       
        

This registry cleaner (component) is (mind you that I dont compared &quot;entry to entry&quot; is along the lines of Auslogic's and Eusing's ... very good and I am not 
saying you need all 3 of these, though having this program provides you with many other tools then just a registry cleaner, so it doesnt hurt to try it.

   
- ![Wise Registry Cleaner](/techHQ/progIcons/system_tools/WiseRegCleaner_MAINICON.jpg)  [Wise Registry Cleaner](http://www.wisecleaner.com/)     
   
Wise Registry Cleaner is another &quot;Wise&quot; product that I have recently tried and to be honest, It (like Wise Disk Cleaner) is not a replacement for some tools 
like &quot;JV16 Power Tools&quot; (which is not free, like this program is), though it has just enough features that are not in other freewares (at least &quot;all together
in the same freeware&quot;, that makes this worth trying 
     
####The main features: 


-	Complete  Registry Backup
-	Registry Cleaning (of course) ...               
    
   -	I can not say if its better than &quot;Auslogic's Reg Cleaner&quot; or say ... &quot;Glary Uitilities's Reg Cleaner&quot;, though it is along the same lines
   -	BOTH my 32bit XP and 64bit Windows 7 Machines had Wise Clean the registry and I selected the defaut entries Wise says are &quot;Safe&quot; to remove.
            I HAVE NOT experienced any ill effects of any kind on either machine
        
-	Registry Defrag
-	System Tuneup 
                
	-	Tips and suggestions for settings to disable/change to make your computer perform better
                      
    -	I am still testing this out, ... I dont expect a &quot;great improvement&quot;, though for someone who has never tweaked their computer.. this could help.
                       
    -	As with all programs like this, read what the &quot;tweak&quot; is doing before you do it or you may have strange results ... just &quot;read before your 
            click&quot; is what I am saying.
 
 
I admit this is not something you need to do on a regular basis. I have run Aulogic's Reg Defrag on my older XP machine and it freed about 1.6MB of space. If you haven't 
formatted in awhile (or EVER) you may want to give a try ... if you regularly install and remove alot of software you may want to try this more often ... but even
 I would only run this every few months or a year or so ... no need to run registry defrags all the time
