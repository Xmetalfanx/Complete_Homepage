p These are not for novices and I have found some (non-listed below) registry &quot;cleaners&quot; to cause alot of issues ....remember &quot;IF IT AIN&apos;T BROKE.... DONT FIX IT&quot;. Having said that, not one of the programs I have listed below have EVER caused a problem on any of my computers (I wouldn&apos;t suggest anything that would harm computers to anyone).

p Be aware that this is not for people that dont know what they are doing, as I said. These programs make it easy to restore your cleaned entries, but if your  not comfortable &quot;messing with&quot; the registry ... DON&apos;T MESS with it.

          | JV16&apos;s Reg Cleaner and it HAS been awhile since I ran that registry cleaner, but this one did find a few hundred entries .... it has been almost 36 hours since I have run this cleaner and I hace NO ILL EFFECTS. I have run registry &quot;cleaners&quot; before that remove a ton of entries (1/2 of them valid) and in some cases windows is not able to boot afterwards.  
        
        p Best news is .. this is freeware too.
  
      p I am not saying its a &quot;must have&quot; but still a good program

        | Some of the tasks this program can perform, are: Invalid Shortcut Fixer/Remover, Temp File Remover (scans whole HDD), Trace remover, Registry Cleaner, Start-up Manager, and most useful a new user (if you ask me) a 1-Click Maintenance feature that performs selected tasks automatically for the user.

        | This registry cleaner (component) is (mind you that I dont compared &quot;entry to entry&quot; is along the lines of Auslogic&apos;s and Eusing&apos;s ... very good and I am not saying you need all 3 of these, though having this program provides you with many other tools then just a registry cleaner, so it doesnt hurt to try it.

        | This is by far the best registry cleaner I have  come across. I will post a full epinion (opinion) at epinion.com, as soon as they are done with the maintenance on their site. (I cant not post it until then). It will have details on this program there.
  
      p.justify
        | This is an overall system Tools program with start menu cleaner, registry cleaner, registry compactor (I have run into ALOT OF issues with this on Vista and Windows 7, but Reg Compactor works 100% no issues on Windows XP), and many many more options.

        | HAVING SAID ALL THAT .. I wouldn&apos;t use this program if you are really new to computers and dont know what your doing (unless your like me, years ago, and accept you can mess things up .. .but want to learn and test stuff anyway)

        | Wise Registry Cleaner is another &quot;Wise&quot; product that I have recently tried and to be honest, It (like Wise Disk Cleaner) is not a replacement for some tools like &quot;JV16 Power Tools&quot; (which is not free, like this program is), though it has just enough features that are not in other freewares (at least &quot;all together in the same freeware&quot;, that makes this worth trying

            li I can not say if its better than &quot;Auslogic&apos;s Reg Cleaner&quot; or say ... &quot;Glary Uitilities&apos;s Reg Cleaner&quot;, though it is along the same lines
            
            li BOTH my 32bit XP and 64bit Windows 7 Machines had Wise Clean the registry and I selected the defaut entries Wise says are &quot;Safe&quot; to remove. I HAVE NOT experienced any ill effects of any kind on either machine

          li As with all programs like this, read what the &quot;tweak&quot; is doing before you do it or you may have strange results ... just &quot;read before your click&quot; is what I am saying.
