            This program is a little tool I have always seen, but I was never sure if it worked... Turns out it does, and works great tool. Might be one of my Must have            programs very soon.

  <p>This is the sort of program that you should run alot if you ask me (if you dont use the computer for a few days, than you dont need to run in then)... 
  I run CCleaner everytime i get off the internet, as it should only take aboue 15 seconds (at MOST) ...and Cleanup from time to time.
