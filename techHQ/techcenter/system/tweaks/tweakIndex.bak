        <p>This section is long overdue, if you ask me... I will mainly be pasting a collection of programs and links to get it started fast, but it should expand quickly</p>
        <p><a href="../../personal/myPics/me/tn.jpg">Xmetalfanx's Security Reg File.reg</a> - Click here to download (and &quot;run&quot;) this  file that I have created that will secure 
(based on several Security Scanners I had run on my system) ... PLEASE create a restore point, and backup your registry before adding this. I should be able to create a quick *undo&quot; file,
 but there is none at the moment ... I have added comments to all, or at least MOST OF the tweaks, explaining what it is said to be doing, but considering every system is so unique, I can NOT 
BE HELD RESPONSIBLE for any damage it may cause (it shouldn't be a problem).... </p>
        <p>PLEASE DO NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTTTTTTTTTTT RUN this reg file if the computer you are using (say a company pc) is not your own. </p>
