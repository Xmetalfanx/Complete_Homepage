        NOTE: I have had alot of issues with the new &quot;upgrade&quot; 6.x branch and do not care for it...
        My liking is for the old 5.x branch by the ORIGINAL developer. I am not trashing the new group working on Eraser...
        just stating that it really needs work.. Doing basic tasks I have done for years crashes, Eraser 6 (folder wiping, filing wiping ...etc)
        right &quot;ot of the gate&quot;

<p>
  This is the sort of program that you should run alot if you ask me (if you dont use the computer for a few days, than you dont need to run in then)...
  I run CCleaner everytime i get off the internet, as it should only take aboue 15 seconds (at MOST) ...and Cleanup from time to time.
