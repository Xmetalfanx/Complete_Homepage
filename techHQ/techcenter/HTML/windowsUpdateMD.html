<h2 id="what-you-need"><a name="what-you-need" href="#what-you-need"></a>What you need</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.getfirefox.com" target="_blank">Firefox</a> (a web browser alternative to IE … for those that do not already know)</li>
  <li><a href="http://windowsupdate.62nds.com/" target="_blank">WindizUpdate Plugin / Addon</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-to-do?"><a name="what-to-do?" href="#what-to-do?"></a>What to do?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Once you have Firefox Installed, </li>
  <li>go to the Windiz Website above and install the plugin. (note: you may need to specifically allow that site to be able to install plugins) …</li>
  <li>Run "Scan my Computer" like you would on Microsoft’s Update. </li>
  <li>
    <p>INSTALLING THE UPDATES</p>
    <ol>
      <li>First you may (Like MS’s) just let the updater do everything … download and install … ) which is perfectly fine</li>
      <li>
        <p>This site also allows you to (in an easier manner) download them and install them later…. they are located in the<br>
          <span class="redtext">C:|WUTEMP</span> folder </p>
        <p><strong>Comments:</strong> What this does is basically the same as Microsoft, but for those who don’t like MS scanning their system OR have problems 
        with Microsoft’s Website.<br>
          I do currently have my AutoUpdate/Automatic update( ..whatever) Service in XP set at DISABLED. I know you have to turn on two of the services to even 
          get MS’s<br>
          scanner to work. </p>
        <p class="mainProgDescript">Note: i am not sure if this is "XP Only" at the moment. … not saying it is or it isn’t </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

<h4 id="what-you-need?"><a name="what-you-need?" href="#what-you-need?"></a>What you Need?</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html" target="_blank"> Belarc Adviser</a> -<br>
  is a tool that scans various areas in your system and then tell you what programs you have installed, what some of the "basic" and "no so basic" hardware info about your computer is AND according to the latest Security bulletin (I THINK its the latest at the time the last version of Belarc was released .. . ) what Windows updates and/or hotfixes your system is missing, it also may find problem updates that "need to be reinstalled" … this is a GREAT TOOL if you ask me</p>
<h4 id="what-to-do?"><a name="what-to-do?" href="#what-to-do?"></a>What to do?</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Just run Belarc by clicking the Belarc Icon on your Start Menu OR Desktop </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your Browser will open with "Profile" of your PC and look for where it says <span class="redtext">System Security Scanner</span> and look at where it
     says<br>
      <span class="redtext">"Microsoft Security Updates"</span> (This screenshot was taken from a PC with all patches, but you may have a red X and a message</p>
    <pre><code data-origin="<pre><code>                like &amp;amp;quot;3 patches/hotfixes missing) 
</code></pre>">                like &amp;quot;3 patches/hotfixes missing) 
</code></pre>
    <ul>
      <li><img src="/techHQ/techcenter/MARKDOWN/UPDATE/SSS.jpg" alt="Belarc Summary Screenshot" width="518" height="76"></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<ol>
  <li>when you Click that it will take you down the page and list the patches you need in a link for to Microsoft</li>
  <li>go to the MS link and download the patches manually or go to a site like <a href="http://windowsupdate.62nds.com/" target="_blank">WindizUpdate Plugin /<br>
    Addon</a> (Listed above) and go to the "search" menu on the left … copy and paste the patch you need (AKA "<span class="redtext">Q22423</span>")<br>
    into that and manually get the exe of the patch from <a href="http://windowsupdate.62nds.com/" target="_blank">WindizUpdate Plugin / Addon</a> … this way you can back<br>
    those exe’s up onto a CD-R and install them in other computers or just plain know what updates you need if you reformat so that you do not have to waste a ton of time<br>
    re-downloading the updates you previously had already :D </li>
</ol>
