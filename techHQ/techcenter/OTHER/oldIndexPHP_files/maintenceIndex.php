  <p>This is a new section to help do regular Windows Maintenance on your computer to keep it healthy, happy and running smoothly ... This is a section that will be under heavy construction and contain many elements of other sections I had up (FAQ's and PC Opt's Sections) ... organized into a cleaner format.

  <p>I have seen ALOT of ads on TV for &quot;Go to this site and we will scan for problems and clean your registry automatically ... etc&quot; ....
  </p>    
  <p>I dont like them personally... Typically they are sites that give you false information on &quot;errors&quot; and &quot;infections&quot; ... then &quot;TO GET RID OF THESE ISSUES ... BUY OUR PRODUCT&quot; ... is the only soluton they give ...
  </p>    
  <p>I hate that. Just follow the instructions on these pages and your computer will be happy with you and visa-versa. Granted that not all these tasks are needed. (say a &quot;Registry Defrag&quot; ... even those that install and remove alot of Windows software, do not need to regularly do registry defrags). These are just some steps that when you add them up, result in a more optimized PC. 
  </p>    
  <p>I am not going to say your computer will be twice as fast... or the issues you have due to the fact you have a low amount of memory will not be there ... .
