###This is a Quick Guide on how to Optimize your Computer

This will Combine some items that are a located in the links on the left, so if you want more information, please check out my sub-pages in this section </p>
        <ol> 
         
  - *(NoTE: after working on a family members computer, I found that XP-Antispy also works (new versions anyway) on Vista)* Run a program called <a href="http://www.xp-antispy.org/" target="_blank">XP-Antispy</a> to get rid of default problems in Windows XP, as well as change settings to protect your privacy and your system</p>
        
-  Get a Program Like [WinPatrol](http://www.winpatrol.com) (or you can go to run and type in &quot;<span class="code">msconfig</span>&quot;) ... this program will show you what programs are running in the Background at startup, and in some cases, show you a description of them, for &quot;confusing entries&quot;. 

I do find that some of them are all wrong... like my antivirus being detected as &quot;a special&quot; modem driver..

-  Get programs like [Malwarebytes](http://www.malwarebytes.org") and [Super Anti-Spyware](http://www.superantispyware.com/) to scan for Spyware. 

	This is software that tracks where you go on the web, what you search for and some keyloggers can even track your password.</span></p>
 
1.	Get a Program called [SpywareBlaster](http://www.wilderssecurity.net/spywareblaster.html)
    
  This doesn't actually detect spyware but rather prevents certain Active-X scripts from installing spyware in the first place. It also has an updating host file that  will prevents certain types of ads (not a popup killer) from displaying, by adding them as &quot;local addresses&quot;  to your host file.

  -  Get a Good Antivirus. Not all AV's are equal.
   	- Some that I recommend are:
    
              NaN. 
            NaN. 
          NaN. 
        NaN.             <ul>
                  - <a href="http://www.kaspersky.com" target="_blank">Kaspersky</a> *
                  - Ffreeware Antiviruses - Either one (but ONLY ONE) are great choices ... you cant go wrong picking either one
                   
                  - a href="http://www.avira.com/en/avira-free-antivirus" target="_blank">Avira</a></li>
                      <li><a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download" target="_blank">Avast</a></li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li><a href="http://www.bitdefender.com" target="_blank">Bit Defender</a> -(2010 comment- I have not tried this one in YEARS)</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li> Some Anti-virus Scanners I<em> do NOT LIKE</em> are:
                <ul>
                  <li><a href="http://www.grisoft.com" target="_blank">AVG</a>  
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <ul>
                <li><a href="http://www.mcafee.com" target="_blank">Mcafee</a> (detects <strong>Poorly</strong>)</li>
                <li><span class="redtext">Norton </span>(better then Mcafee but same problems still, and a RESOURCE HOG !... this (even IF, it was good may protect a system.... but it slows even fast computers down so much, you'd think its a virus itself)</li>
                <li><span class="redtext">PC-Cillin </span>(no comment on detection... just had a fight with the CEO on a Public forum (not the PC-Cillin forum) on him telling me what AV i &quot;can like&quot; and &quot;recommend&quot;. 
                    I will always refuse to use this program from now on)<br />
                </li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Get a Firewall. Hardware ones are the best, although there are many Software one.
            <ol>
              <li>Some good ones to try are:
                <ul>
                  <li class="redtext">Outpost (free or pro),</li>
                  <li class="redtext"> <a href="http://www.zonelabs.com">Zone Alarm (free or pro)</a>,  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Software Firewalls to Avoid are: 
                <ul>
                  <li class="redtext">Mcafee Firewall, Norton Internet Security, and Black Ice, among others. </li>
                  <li> Many users feel safe with these programs, while they actually offer poor protection and a false sense of security. I think many like 
                    <span class="redtext">Mcafee and Norton </span>are very bloated (take up alot more system power and space then is really needed) for a firewall anyway.<br /> 
                    <br /> 
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>If are experiencing reboots after a BSOD, that is most likely caused by a windows setting that tells the system to reboot on &quot;failure&quot;... .to turn this off, go to the start menu and then RIGHT click &quot;my computer&quot;... go to &quot;Advanced&quot;, then click &quot;Settings&quot; under &quot;startup and recovery&quot; ... under &quot;system failure&quot; 
            you will see a check in the box, next to &quot;automatic restart&quot;... uncheck it and your computer will not restart after BSOD all the time... this will NOT PREVENT you from getting a possible BSOD.</li>
        </ol>
