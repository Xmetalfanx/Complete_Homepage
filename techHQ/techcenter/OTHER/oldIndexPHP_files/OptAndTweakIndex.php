      <p>This Section is a mix between the PC Optimization Section and Tweak Section.  I am tweaking the templates, and testing layout changes to see what layout looks best. I don't want to overload the new subheaders (below the main navigation) AND I don't want to have a never-ending leftbanner (granted I have a few ideas for content I have not put up yet).</p>

      <p class="header">This is a Quick Guide on how to Optimize your Computer</p>
    <p class="justify"> This will Combine some items that are a located in the links on the left, 
        so if you want more information, please check out my sub-pages in this section </p>
      <ol>
        <li>          <em>(NoTE: after working on a family members computer, I found that XP-Antispy also works (new versions anyway) on Vista and Windows 7... 
        I can NOT comment on Windows 8)</em> </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Run a program called <a href="http://www.xp-antispy.org/" target="_blank">XP-Antispy</a> to get rid of 
            default problems in Windows XP, as well as change settings to protect your privacy and your system<br /><br /></li>
        </ul>
        <li>Get a Program Like <a href="http://www.startup-mechanic.com"
                target="_blank">WinPatrol </a> (or you can go to <em>run</em> and type in &quot;<span class="code">msconfig</span>&quot;) ... this program will show you what programs are running 
        in the Background at startup, and in some cases, show you a description of them, for &quot;confusing entries&quot;.<br /><br /> </li>
        <li>G<span class="justify">et programs like <a
                href="http://www.malwarebytes.org" target="_blank">MalwareBytes</a> and <a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank">Super Anti-Spyware </a> to
                 scan for Spyware. 
        This is software that tracks where you go on the web, what you search for and some keyloggers can even track your password. Granted that:</span>
          <ol>
            <li><span class="justify">Tracking Cookies are a nuisance <br />
            <br />
            </span> </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Get a Program called <a href="http://www.wilderssecurity.net/spywareblaster.html" target="_blank">Spyware Blaster</a>. 
          This doesn't actually detect spyware but rather
          prevents certain Active-X scripts from installing spyware in the first place. It also has an updating host file that 
          will prevents certain types of ads (not a popup killer) from displaying, by adding them as &quot;local addresses&quot;
          to your host file.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>** Get a Good Antivirus. Not all AV's are equal.
          <ul>
            <li>Some that I recommend are:
              <ul>
                <li><a href="http://www.kaspersky.com" target="_blank">Kaspersky</a> * - Has gotten a little </li>
                <li>Eset's NOD32</li>
                <li>Freeware Antiviruses - <span class="italics">Either one (but ONLY ONE) are great choices </span>... you cant go wrong picking either one
                  <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://www.avira.com/en/avira-free-antivirus" target="_blank">Avira</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.avira.com/en/avira-free-antivirus" target="_blank"><img src="../progIcons/security/AVs/1589__Avast!FreeAntivirus5_icon.png" alt="Avast Icon" width="32" height="32" class="iconsLeft" /></a><a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download" target="_blank">Avast</a></li>
                    <li></li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li> Some Anti-virus Scanners I<em> do NOT LIKE</em> are:
              <ul>
                <li><a href="http://www.grisoft.com" target="_blank">AVG</a> - Apparently the 2012 finally gets better results detection wise, but &quot;in the real world&quot; (me helping users, and forming an opinion from that), AVG still detects poorly, if you ask me. I have seen it let MANY infections right by </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="http://www.mcafee.com" target="_blank">Mcafee</a> (detects <strong>Poorly</strong>)</li>
              <li><span class="redtext">Norton </span>(better then Mcafee but same problems still, and a RESOURCE HOG !... this (even IF, it was good may protect a system.... but it slows even fast computers down so much, you'd think its a virus itself)</li>
              <li><span class="redtext">PC-Cillin </span> - Constantly rated in the bottom 1/2 of results as far as detection goes and stays there consistantly<br />
              </li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Get a Firewall. Hardware ones are the best, although there are many software firewalls, as well.
          <ul>
            <li>Software firewalls  may not me &quot;perfect&quot; for blocking so-called &quot;Hackers&quot;. Some software unfortunately alerts you whenever a connection is made and acts like &quot;THATS A HACKER&quot;, repeatedly alerting you. I ASSURE YOU VIEWERS OF MY SITE, that I would never recommend any of those programs
              <ul>
                <li>Note: Please Do not make the mistake the of thinking when ever &quot;somethimg&quot; contacts the internet, it is bad. A simple program with &quot;auto check for new versions&quot; setting in the programs &quot;Options&quot; or &quot;Preferences&quot; window of that program that can easily be disabled and is not malicious at all</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Some good ones to try are:
              <ul>
                <li>Outpost (free or pro),</li>
                <li><a href="http://www.zonelabs.com">Zone Alarm (free or pro)</a><br /><br /> 
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If are experiencing reboots after a BSOD, that is most likely caused by a windows setting that tells the system to reboot on &quot;failure&quot;... 
              <ul>
                <li>To turn this off:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Go to the Start menu and then RIGHT click &quot;my computer&quot;... </li>
                    <li>Go to &quot;Advanced&quot;, then click &quot;Settings&quot; under &quot;startup and recovery&quot; ... </li>
                    <li>Under &quot;system failure&quot; 
                      you will see a check in the box, next to &quot;automatic restart&quot;... uncheck it and your computer will not restart after BSOD all the time... this will NOT PREVENT you from getting a possible BSOD, which in my experience is either a poorly coded program or more likely a driver (for hardware) or actual hardware issue itself</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
