    <p>a long overdue segment on Drive imaging ...that I planned on added over a year ago, but never got around to. This will (in general ..
    what I don't cover, I will link to sites that do) cover </p>

      s<a href="http://www.macrium.com/reflectfree.asp" target="_blank" class="progName">Macrium Reflect </a>- One I heard about from friends and have
       re-tried ... seems better than it did before, but maybe I didn't try it long enough before </li>

    </ul>
    <p>I have not had to restore with any of these yet, but I AM grateful for that ... I am not knocking any of these ... I am just listing a few to give you options and to see &quot;which one works best for me&quot;. I am impressed by all of these, though for newbies I will say DriveImage XML's Interface can be a turnoff, although anyone who reads the manual will find how easy that program is to use too</p>
<p class="boldItalics">Others</p>
    <ul>
<li><a href="http://clonezilla.org/" target="_blank">Clonezilla</a> (which I just heard of recently, and HONESTLY never tried before, </li>
        <li><span class="redtext">partImage</span> (a linux based drive imager that you can use for Ubuntu partitions</li>
        <li><span class="redtext">PartImage-ng</span> (I currently remember reading about this one, but I have no clue what the differences are between this and partImage are)</li>
        <li><span class="redtext">DeviceImage</span> (APPARENTLY the new &quot;maintained&quot; so called &quot;version&quot; of partImage)</li>

        <li>shareware imagers like <a href="http://www.acronis.com/homecomputing/products/trueimage/" target="_blank">TrueImage</a> for example,
        I plan to link to sites on, but do not plan on going into much details here since the others I listed above are freewares/ open source, and these ones are NOT)
         </li>

        <li>I am not sure how much info on <span class="redtext">Norton Ghost</span> I will have due to the versions I remember (I used back in Windows
        9x days ) do not work on Windows XP and higher  partitions.. in fact ... If I remember correctly.... the last version of Symantec Ghost I tried ... actually works on FAT  (16 and 32bit) partitions and not NTFS (which is what WindowsXP and up, are) partitions anyway... I know they have updated it but I have ZERO experience with it </li>
        <li>** WHAT SOFTWARE TO USE TO BURN THE IMAGES to external media** (Not counting the fact you can use an external hard drive, and/or a USB &quot;Thumb&quot; drive)
          <ul>
            <li class="code2">Remember ... even if your computer is covered under some warranty .. in any sense if your Hard drive fails and has to be replaced ...
            a drive image can help get you back to EXACTLY how your computer was (at the time you took the image of the drive of course).. This may be a few hours ...depending on your computer .. but if this means &quot;Hours ... not days or weeks ... AND not losing your personal data&quot; ... that's even better ... at least if you ask me.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>** What are the Boot CD/DVD (and there are bootable USB drives but I need to research that more) options you have to ACCESS the backed up images.
        <span class="italics">(What good are the backups of you have to &quot;restore everything&quot; to get to them?) </span></li>
      </ul>
