The more free programs I find, the more I wonder why people bother paying for programs like Winzip.  I DO SUPPORT &quot;donating&quot; when you can to help the development of your favorite open source/free choice, AS WELL AS the fact that I am a big supporter of WinRar.  IF there was a commercial (not free) program I'd advice people buy in this category, it would be WinRar.  While Winrar, doesn't have some of the &quot;advanced&quot; (ftp uploading/ backup scheduling)
     
(Something I am looking into: For years I just assumed <span class="blue">7-Zip File Manager </span>, was the official 7-zip client (though I am sure 7-zip's compression format IS open source). I knew many other programs supported 7-zip, and was surprised that this week I found that other clients support some features of 7-zip, not even the newest alpha versions (Test of a Test version, basically) supported these same features (example - being able to add and remove files to an existing 7-zip file). 
  
  
I am NOT saying &quot;Dump <span class="blue">7-zip File Manager </span>, if you use it now&quot;. I CAN NOT STRESS THAT ENOUGH. I am just pointing out that even some of these lesser known compression programs such as PeaZip or HaoZip DO support some features that what I thought was the &quot;official 7 zip program&quot; does not. 

In other-words ... my point is ...<span class="italics">&quot;Hey .. if you have 7-zip File Manager... maybe you should try one of the others ... you may like it better&quot; </span> ... that's all

##Compression/Archivers Programs

-	![7-zip](/techHQ/progIcons/system_tools/compression/51__7zip.png)  [7-zip File Manager](http://www.7zip.org)

This program supports:

    -	writing:
       -	7zip and Zip files
         -    Doesn't edit existing (add/remove files from ... ) 7zip files. I have tried 			the latest alpha (test of a test version, in layman's terms) and it still 				doesn't seem to work, though the developer is taking user feedback, and is hard 		at work on it

    -   reading:
         - Bz2, Gzip, Zip, 7zip, Rar, Rpm, Tgz, xar, deb, and cabs ... JUST TO NAME a few of the most popular formats


-	![BandiZip Icon](../../progIcons/system_tools/compression/Bandizip32_134.gif)  [Bandizip](http://www.bandicam.com/bandizip/help/)

	- Reads most common archive formats         
	-  Writes Zip and 7zip, however it can not edit (add/remove files and folders) from an existing 7zip file

-	![FreeArch Icon](../../progIcons/system_tools/compression/freearc-installer_102.jpg)  [FreeArc]()

	<span class="underlineBold">Comments</span>: Seemed promising .. i have tried a few tasks and every single one of them (note: version .666 which has not been updated since 2010, apparently) resulting in a program crash/freeze.        
			
	I WILL try this again later as I am trying only the portable version in Windows (I use Windows7 64bit), at the moment. 	I want to be far as perhaps its only the Windows Portable version that is buggy .. or perhaps this portable version is fine on 32bit PC's .. I want to give FreeArc a fair shot
  
-	![HaoZip Icon](../../progIcons/system_tools/compression/HaoZip_101.jpg)  [HaoZip](http://www.haozip.com/Eng/index_en.htm)

	Writes: Zip, 7Zip, .Tar.Gz, .Tar.bz2, and a few others          

	This is a Chinease archiving program that I just saw posted about on a comment section, and I figured I would give it 	a chance ... man am I happy I did. Between performance and speed, this is VERY close to WinRar, and HaoZip is very well	done if you ask me.  HaoZip is my new favorite in this category, and I have only used it for half a day so far.
		  
	When adding files to an archive (Interface wise ... it REALLY reminds me of WinRar) 
  
-	![IzArc](../../progIcons/system_tools/compression/77__izarc.png)  [IzARc](http://www.izarc.org/)

	<p class="boldCourier">Reads most common archive formats  </p>          
		   
	<p class="boldCourier">Writes Zip and 7zip files AND  </p>          
			
	With alot of formerly free zip programs going shareware (Power Archiver, ... FilZip,...etc ), I think this is still a good 
	program that has the same interface as Winzip, but has remained free
   
-	![KauiZip Icon](../../progIcons/system_tools/compression/KuaiZip_128.jpg)  [KauiZip](http://www.kauizip.com)

	<p class="boldCourier">Reads most common archive formats  </p>          
        
    <p class="boldCourier">Writes Zip and 7zip files AND .Kz which is a format only used in this program and it is 
    SUPPOSE to be more compressed then zip and 7zip files. </p>          
        
   Comments: I have to say that I am not knocking .kz's format though it is NOT common and from the tests (just compressing 
   random items in <span class="redtext">.zip, .7zip, and .kz </span> ... , .kz seemed to be about the same as 
   either of the other two formats (speed compressing, AND size of compressed file).          
        
   You DO NOT HAVE to use the .kz format, and I personally would advice against it, as almost all compression programs 
   nowadays can read <span class="redtext">7zip and Zip </span> files, you can (whether your sending the files to 
   someone else or you decide to switch compression/archiving programs later, you will save yourself some headaches. 
         
        
        <p class="justify">
          <em>Ex - you have all your files in .kz compression files and then switch programs (to use everyday .,,, To find out that, the &quot;new&quot; program can not read .kz files. 
          </em>
        </p>          
        
        <p class="justify">
          <em>With 7Zip or Zip, you may even switch/try new compression programs to your &quot;heart's content&quot; and none of them should have any issues reading or writing ZIP or 7ZIP files.
          </em>
        </p>     
  
-	![Peazip Icon](http://www.peazip.org/index.html)  [Peazip](../../progIcons/system_tools/compression/pea_MAINICON.jpg)

	<ul>          
		<li>Reads most common archive formats   </li>          
		<li>Writes Zip and 7zip files      </li>        
	</ul>          
        
	Comments: This is an old freeware I have known about for years, though I never really gave it a chance (I had chosen to 
	use Power Archiver or Winrar). The more I mess around with it, the more I like it. I do have to say I like HaoZip best now 
	(seems like a Winrar clone, though Winrar writes .RAR and .ZIP files ... HaoZip (and Peazip, for that matter) write .ZIP, 
	.7zip, and a few linux formats that I know of (.tar.gz, .tar.bz2) 

     
  
 -	![Universal  Extractor](../../progIcons/system_tools/compression/722__universalExtractor.gif)  [Universal  Extractor]() 

	The developer(s) of this program fully admit there might be problems and that its in the beta stages... I for one .. 
	have not run into any of these issues as of yet .... This program is a context menu App (right click) and can extract MANY 
	archive formats INCLUDING EXE and MSI (Microsoft Installers) ....      
		  
	Univesal Extractor, does have some EXE-extraction support) .. you can extract the missing file to where it is needed and 
	see if that will fix the issue .
		
		  
	AS OF THIS BEING TYPED... THIS PROGRAM is FREEWARE       
    
    
-	![Winrar](../../progIcons/system_tools/compression/4__winrar.png)  [WinRaR](http://www.rarsoft.com)

      
	<p class="boldItalics">** NOT FREEWARE** </p>        

	One of the fastest programs to handle archives, that I have tried. This is the only program that can create RAR files.
    *(The freewares would have to pay WinRar for the right to create Rar files in their programs ... licencing/legal issues, 
    in other words) *
       
    This is not free, as I have stated, though I like it so much, i feel the need to mention it here
