#Registry Tools
  
Before I begin, I am not for "Run as many Registry Cleaners as you can" or even it's a "needed" tasks for all users. These are just some options.

As with all computer software, use at your own risk... just because I haven;t run into an  issue with any of these programs, doesn't mean you will not... They can be powerful and dangerous  (IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR DOING). Do not take that that wrong way though ... most make it easy  to restore (actually they all do) anything that it removes. You may want to start in Safe Mode  and see how to restore items "just in case"... IF nothing goes wrong, your A-OK. (and 95% of the  time this is the case); however, IF something does go wrong, you know how to restore the removed  items and after 2 reboots (one in safe mode to restore then another back to "Normal" Windows) and  a few simple steps (based on which Cleaner you use), your back to normal and your PC is OK again.
  
If your not comfortable doing any registry cleaning, then DON'T DO IT. Messing stuff up a  little is how I learned all I know (well most) about computers, but some people really don't want to chance it and that's perfectly OK.
 

###Registry Cleaners and Registry "Defragmenting" Tools</p>

     This is something that you really dont have to do alot but if your computer is running  sluggish, and its been a LONG time since you formatted or reinstalled a new version of Windows, you may want to give this a try.
     
     AGAIN, I have run into issues with NON-"
      <a href="http://www.macecraft.com/" target="_blank">JV16</a>" Registry programs; although all of the programs (all freewares too) that I have tried from Aulogic seem to work great.
     
     I did not notice any "GREAT IMPROVEMENT" in WIndows 7, after using this program, but it did remove (so it said) 1.2MB from my registry.

	I do not recommend many registry cleaner; however, this is an exception. This is made by Auslogics which is the Defragmenting program I have been using for awhile now. I usually only use <a href="http://www.macecraft.com/" target="_blank">JV16's Reg Cleaner</a>and it HAS been awhile since I ran that registry cleaner, but this one did find a few hundred entries .... it has been almost 36 hours since I have run this cleaner and I hace NO ILL EFFECTS. I have run registry "cleaners" before that remove a ton of entries (1/2 of them valid) and in some cases Windows is not able to boot afterwards. Best news is .. this is freeware too.

	I am not saying its a "must have" but still a good program.
    


-	![CCleaner Icon ](../../progIcons/security/cleaners/959__CCv2.gif )  [CCleaner ] (http://www.ccleaner.com )
   
      Everyone seems to know CCleaner as the tempeorary file deleting program, but there is a Regisry Cleaning tool in CCleaner as well. (Click the "Registry" icon on the left under    "Cleaner".
      
      This doesn't remove alot of entries, but it does remove a good number of them. (After all, what good is "My registry cleaner removes more entries than CCleaner!" ?? If it removes too many entries and when you go to reboot, your computer will not start?

     (FREE or Pro available, though I use the very powerful free version)
      
      Some of the tasks this program can perform, are: Invalid Shortcut Fixer/Remover, Temp File   Remover (scans whole HDD), Trace remover, Registry Cleaner, Start-up Manager, and most useful a new user (if you ask me) a 1-Click Maintenance feature that performs selected tasks automatically for the user. 
      
      <p>This registry cleaner (component) is (mind you that I dont compared "entry to entry" is along the lines of Auslogic's and Eusing's ... very good and I am not saying you need all 3 of these, though having this program provides you with many other tools then just a registry cleaner, so it doesnt hurt to try it.

    <div class="progTableDesc">
      <p>*** NO LONG FREEWARE; however, one of the few non-free programs i recommend 100% ***</p>
      
      This is by far the best registry cleaner I have come across. I will post a  full epinion (opinion) at epinion.com, as soon as they are done with the maintenance on their  site. (I cant not post it until then). It will have details on this program there.</p>
      
      This is an overall system Tools program with start menu cleaner, registry cleaner, registry compactor (I have run into ALOT OF issues with this on Vista and Windows 7, but Reg Compactor works 100% no issues on Windows XP), and many many more options.
      
      <p class="maroonText">HAVING SAID ALL THAT .. I wouldn't use this program if you are really new to computers and dont know what your doing (unless your like me, years ago, and accept you can mess things up .. .but want to learn and test stuff anyway). Dont get me wrong, this has only messed things up once or twice and thats when I and I alone selected "too many things" to remove and even then .... rebooting into safe mode, restoring those items and then rebooting again, solved the issue</p>

    <p class="quoted">You should use RegSupreme because it's a good idea to keep the registry as  clean as possible. Here are some examples to help you understand how RegSupreme can truly    help you:</p>

      <p class="mainSiteUpdates">I have personally found the old Reg Cleaners to be better and have

      Wise Registry Cleaner is another "Wise" product that I have recently tried and to be  honest, It (like Wise Disk Cleaner) is not a replacement for some tools like "JV16 Power    Tools" (which is not free, like this program is), though it has just enough features that are  not in other freewares (at least "all together in the same freeware", that makes this worth trying
      
      <p>The main features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Complete Registry Backup</li>
        <li>Registry Cleaning (of course) ...
        <ul>
          <li>I can not say if its better than "Auslogic's Reg Cleaner" or say ... "Glary
          Uitilities's Reg Cleaner", though it is along the same lines</li>
          <li>BOTH my 32bit XP and 64bit Windows 7 Machines had Wise Clean the registry and I
          selected the defaut entries Wise says are "Safe" to remove. I HAVE NOT experienced any
          ill effects of any kind on either machine</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Registry Defrag</li>
        <li>System Tuneup</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Tips and suggestions for settings to disable/change to make your computer perform
          better</li>
          <li>I am still testing this out, ... I dont expect a "great improvement", though for
          someone who has never tweaked their computer.. this could help.</li>
          <li>As with all programs like this, read what the "tweak" is doing before you do it or
          you may have strange results ... just "read before your click" is what I am saying.</li>

###Registry Editors
    <span class="mainProgDescript">replacements for REGEDIT, that have more features</span>
  </p>

- [RegEditX ] ( )

<div class="progTables">
 
	RegEditX is basically Regedit.exe with a few added features to make it much more usable

    There is nothing fancy about it, but rather, additions that Mirosoft SHOULD have in Regedit.exe by default.

 -	![regMagik Icon ](../../progIcons/system_tools/registry/RegMagik_101.png )  [regMagiK ] (http://www.regmagik.com/ ) 
   
    Nothing Fancy (you dont need "fancy" in a registry editor) but it  reminds me of Directory Opus (nothing fancy, but just what you need).. it has all the features    you'd expect in a REGEDIT replacement including a slight GUI improvment and Bookmarks/Favorites  for people who edit the same key often.
