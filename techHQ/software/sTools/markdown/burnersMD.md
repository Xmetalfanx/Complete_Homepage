-	[BurnAware ] (http://www.burnaware.com )

	 (There are Pro versions availble, though my comments and review are on the free version)
      
      It has the same bullet points I list in CDBurneXP and InfraRecorder, and it is simple. Not "dumbed down" but "Burning a disc is not "that complicated, so why make it so?" simple. It seems pretty fast (reaction time and burning) too. As I said I like programs that are lite, do what they are suppose to do and do it well.
      
      In my list of recommended burning software, I will include BurnAware 100% from now on.
      
      FOR "NEW" USERS, I am not saying CDBurnerXP OR InfraRecoreder are "complicated" or difficult to use, by any means, though I have to say if you are a new (computer) user, then  BurnAware Free would by my first recommendation. It has a "lite" GUI-"Wizard" (advanced  users, please do not get scared off by this), though (in my opinion) its enough of an Interface to help some users, WITHOUT getting in the way of some more advanced users

    CDBurnerXP, is a simple but powerful image burning program that can handle
       - Data Discs (CDs/DVDs)
       - ISOs/Disc Image Creation and Burning of exisiting images
       - VIDEO DVDS

     This does not have all the "bells and whistle" that may be contained in Nero or Roxio's software, and to be honest, that is what makes this program great. It does what it is suppose  to do and does it well, without being bloated and hard on system resources

      This is an advanced burninng program, that has many advanced options ( I never need to change them anyway), but if you need or want to, they ARE there to change.
     
    This program may turn off some new users, though attract some advanced users.
      
     I have just (even after years of use) the "Disc Layout" view of this program and honestly feel goofy that it took me this long to find it. (This is where you can add folders by "Drag and drop", with an interface similiar to CDBurnerXP for example). I have never (minus a dying  burner) had this program fail me.
      
    In fact If you want to make a (example) VIDEO DVD disc and settings are not correct, when  you add the AUDIO_TS and VIDEO_TS to the "disc project", it will say "hey ... This looks like  this is going to be a VIDEO DVD .. you want me (IMG Burn) to change a few settings on this particular disc's project settings to match VIDEO DVD standards?" (so you do not burn a DVD but are unable to watch it in any DVD player because one setting was off)

I have never had issues with any of program (not counting a dying burner) making "coasters" <span class="italics">(discs that fail in some way and are only good for drink coasters ... or perhaps target practice)</span>or crashing, EVER .. even "beta" (test versions of the next version in line)
  
** I know a few such as BurnAware Free says they can burn Blueray Discs, though I can not comment on that, since I do not have a Blue Ray Burner OR Blue Ray Player
 
I alternate (just "cause") between ImgBurn, CDBurnerXP (my suggestion for new users), and BurnAware ... all of them have pros and "cons" (notice the quotes ...i say Cons, loosely) ... all  of them are free and even if one (I can not remember) is listed as "adware" because the installer  includes an OPTIONAL toolbar... the key word is OPTIONAL. Some people see that and even if they  are installing, they cancel the installer thinking "if i do not install the toolbar, the program  will not install".. NOT TRUE, in these cases... uncheck "install toolbar X " and toolbar is not  installed, and program installer goes to next step.
  
None of the functions of these programs are effected by not installing any toolbars (if  presented with a toolbar prompt during install), either.
