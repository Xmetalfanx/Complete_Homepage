	<p class="redtext">This program has the most comprehensive knowledge of auto-starting locations of any startup monitor (A starting list of auto-run  locations was obtained from David Solomon's &quot;Windows  Internals&quot; seminar), shows you what programs are configured to run during system boot-up or login, and shows you the entries in the order Windows processes them. These programs include ones in your startup folder, Run, RunOnce, and other Registry keys. A &quot;Hide Signed Microsoft Entries&quot; option helps you to zoom in on third-party auto-starting images that have been added to your system. </p>

	&quot;Yeah, yeah, what's the big deal?, Windows has a task manager. I can just use that, eh?&quot;...

	Well not providing any &quot;OMG, that is so COOL&quot; features, this program's GUI is just enough to make my &quot;wow, i should             have gotten this awhile ago&quot; list. the ability to see the             services and the &quot;tree (see        
    
    <a href="../../smiles/shock/eek2.gif" target="_blank">screenshot</a>) of the running processes, is also cool.   

	Also ..&quot;Process Explorer also has a powerful search capability that will quickly show you which  processes have particular handles opened or            DLLs loaded. The unique capabilities of Process Explorer make it useful for tracking down DLL-version problems or handle leaks, and provide insight into the way Windows and applications work&quot;  </em>
