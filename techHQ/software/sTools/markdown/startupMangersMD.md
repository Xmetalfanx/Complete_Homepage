   This  program has the most comprehensive knowledge of auto-starting locations of any startup monitor (A starting list of auto-run locations was obtained from David Solomon's &quot;Windows Internals&quot; seminar), shows you what programs are configured to      run during system boot-up or login, and shows you the entries in the order Windows processes them. These programs include ones in your startup folder, Run, RunOnce, and other Registry keys. A &quot;Hide  Signed Microsoft Entries&quot; option helps you to zoom in on third-party  auto-starting images that have been added to your system.
        
   <span class="redtext">Autoruns works on all versions of Windows.</span>

	Very Similar to Startup Mechanic, although you can create  profiles with this programs, and the &quot;database&quot; that tells you what Items are, is on the net so you have to run it while your connected.
