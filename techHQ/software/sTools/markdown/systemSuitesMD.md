These are the tools I like that fall under the "Overall System Suite" Category. Some of the overall tools (all in one place) these programs have include: Invalid Shortcut Fixer/Remover,  Temp File Remover (scans whole HDD), Trace remover, Registry Cleaner, Start-up Manager, and  more.
  
Below the main section, I plan to add an "alternative suites" chart that has tools with programs called "suite", though they do not have the tools mentioned in the prior paragraph, they still include many useful tools one can use maintaining a computer. 

<span class="redtext">I have tested all of these, and NEVER had any issues</span>  *well the Registry Compactor in one of my favorite programs, Jv16 Power Tools DID goof-up Windows Startup .. I had to go into Linux and rename a file to recover the  registry... AND I DO HAVE TO MENTION, THAT THIS HAPPENED A FEW VERSIONS AGO AND I HAVE NOT TRIED IT SINCE ... SO IT COULD HAVE BEEN A BUG THAT THEY FIXED ALREADY)*; however, that was my only issue in about 12 years PLUS of using JV16 Power Tools and using it ON A CONSTANT BASIS.  I have not had any of these programs cause issues. I have seen similar  program THAT DO cause system goofups, and I will NOT list those here.

As with all programs on my site, these are safe to use... if you find them useful... well that  is your (the person reading this) call. None of the programs I list are shareware/spyware.

    <p class="redtext">*** NO LONG FREEWARE; however, one of the few non-free programs i
        recommend 100% ***</p>
    
    This is by far the best registry cleaner I have come across. I will post a full epinion (opinion) at epinion.com, as soon as they are done with the maintenance on their site. (I cant not post it until then). It will have details on this program  there.
     
     This is an overall system Tools program with start menu cleaner, registry cleaner, registry compactor (I have run into ALOT OF issues with this on Vista and Windows 7, but Reg Compactor works 100% no issues on Windows XP), and many many more options.
     
     THIS IS THE ONLY REGISTRY "CLEANER" I recommend. (Although its really not a complete reg cleaner ... Ccleaner's reg cleaner is not bad) ... alot of other reg cleaners have caused more problems then there worth. That is NOT THE CASE with JV16 Power Tools
        
     <p class="maroonText">HAVING SAID ALL THAT .. I wouldn't use this program if you are really  new to computers and dont know what your doing (unless your like me, years ago, and accept you can mess things up .. .but want to learn and test stuff anyway)</p>

      This is a very lite version of Jv16 Power tools that I found to be decent, while not      having some "advanced" features the regular paid version of Jv16 Power tools has.
