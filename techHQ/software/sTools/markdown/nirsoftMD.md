##Nirsoft Programs    
 
(Link to be added) Look for NirLauncer, which is sort of like a GUI to interact with all of Nirsoft's tools in one. When I can get it, I just download this (NirLauncer) and have all the great Nirsoft Tools at my fingertips ... though if there is a small program you want from Nirsoft, and nothing else ... then you can download them individually.
