	This may be my personal favorite.

 
 -	[JKDefrag ](http://www.emro.nl/freeware )

	This is very good and some may still like this better then MyDefrag. 
          
	I have seen two different GUI's for JKDefrag.

(New name for the new versions of JKDefrag)
               
	This is a good, powerful defragmenter that (from the developer) that has no GUI Interface (read on before you dismiss this) .. the programmer has decided to concentrate on the &quot;base&quot; (defrag/optimizing) of the program, and let others develop an GUI Interface
           
	One of the GUI's I have found (which is identical to one of the two GUIs for JKDefrag) is <a href="http://www.mydefrag.net/" target="_blank">MyDefragGUI</a>

     - This defrags file by file
     - Creator of CCleaner makes this
     - Does a decent job 

-	[UltraDefrag ](http://ultradefrag.sourceforge.net/ )

     Defragmenter that has a Simple Interface, but powerful defragmenting capabilities

Just remember if you defrag with one and then scan with another (say defrag with MyDefrag, and then scan with Defraggler) you may notice the second says its not &quot;perfect&quot;. You then defrag with the second defragmenter, and analyze the partition with the first defragmenter you used and find the FIRST now says its fragmented ... point is, I would stick with one defragmenter.
