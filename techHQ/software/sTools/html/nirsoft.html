    <p>(Link to be added) Look for NirLauncer, which is sort of like a GUI to interact with all of Nirsoft&#39;s tools in one. When
    I can get it, I just download this (NirLauncer) and have all the great Nirsoft Tools at my fingertips ... though if there is a
    small program you want from Nirsoft, and nothing else ... then you can download them individually.</p>
