    <p>These are the tools I like that fall under the &quot;Overall System Suite&quot; Category. Some of the overall tools (all in
    one place) these programs have include: Invalid Shortcut Fixer/Remover, Temp File Remover (scans whole HDD), Trace remover,
    Registry Cleaner, Start-up Manager, and more.</p>
    <p>Below the main section, I plan to add an &quot;alternative suites&quot; chart that has tools with programs called
    &quot;suite&quot;, though they do not have the tools mentioned in the prior paragraph, they still include many useful tools one
    can use maintaining a computer.</p>
    <p>
    <span class="redtext">I have tested all of these, and NEVER had any issues</span> 
    <em>well the Registry Compactor in one of my favorite programs, Jv16 Power Tools DID goof-up Windows Startup .. I had to go
    into Linux and rename a file to recover the registry... AND I DO HAVE TO MENTION, THAT THIS HAPPENED A FEW VERSIONS AGO AND I
    HAVE NOT TRIED IT SINCE ... SO IT COULD HAVE BEEN A BUG THAT THEY FIXED ALREADY)</em>; however, that was my only issue in about
    12 years PLUS of using JV16 Power Tools and using it ON A CONSTANT BASIS. I have not had any of these programs cause issues. I
    have seen similar program THAT DO cause system goofups, and I will NOT list those here.</p>
    <p>As with all programs on my site, these are safe to use... if you find them useful... well that is your (the person reading
    this) call. None of the programs I list are shareware/spyware.</p>

        <p class="redtext">*** NO LONG FREEWARE; however, one of the few non-free programs i recommend 100% ***</p>
        <p>This is by far the best registry cleaner I have come across. I will post a full epinion (opinion) at epinion.com, as
        soon as they are done with the maintenance on their site. (I cant not post it until then). It will have details on this
        program there.</p>
        <p>This is an overall system Tools program with start menu cleaner, registry cleaner, registry compactor (I have run into
        ALOT OF issues with this on Vista and Windows 7, but Reg Compactor works 100% no issues on Windows XP), and many many more
        options.</p>
        <p>THIS IS THE ONLY REGISTRY &quot;CLEANER&quot; I recommend. (Although its really not a complete reg cleaner ...
        Ccleaner&#39;s reg cleaner is not bad) ... alot of other reg cleaners have caused more problems then there worth. That is
        NOT THE CASE with JV16 Power Tools</p>
        <p class="maroonText">HAVING SAID ALL THAT .. I wouldn&#39;t use this program if you are really new to computers and dont
        know what your doing (unless your like me, years ago, and accept you can mess things up .. .but want to learn and test
        stuff anyway)</p>
