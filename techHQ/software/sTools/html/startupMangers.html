    </ul>
    <p>This program has the most comprehensive knowledge of auto-starting locations of any startup monitor (A starting list of
    auto-run locations was obtained from David Solomon&#39;s &quot;Windows Internals&quot; seminar), shows you what programs are
    configured to run during system boot-up or login, and shows you the entries in the order Windows processes them. These programs
    include ones in your startup folder, Run, RunOnce, and other Registry keys. A &quot;Hide Signed Microsoft Entries&quot; option
    helps you to zoom in on third-party auto-starting images that have been added to your system.</p>

          <a href="http://www.Windowsstartup.com">Startup Inspector</a>
        </p>
        <p>Very Similar to Startup Mechanic, although you can create profiles with this programs, and the &quot;database&quot; that
        tells you what Items are, is on the net so you have to run it while your connected.</p>
