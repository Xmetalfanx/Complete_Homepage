        <p class="redtext">This program has the most comprehensive knowledge of auto-starting locations of any startup monitor (A
        starting list of auto-run locations was obtained from David Solomon&#39;s &quot;Windows Internals&quot; seminar), shows you
        what programs are configured to run during system boot-up or login, and shows you the entries in the order Windows
        processes them. These programs include ones in your startup folder, Run, RunOnce, and other Registry keys. A &quot;Hide
        Signed Microsoft Entries&quot; option helps you to zoom in on third-party auto-starting images that have been added to your
        system.</p>

        <p>&quot;Yeah, yeah, what&#39;s the big deal?, Windows has a task manager. I can just use that, eh?&quot;...</p>
        <p>Well not providing any &quot;OMG, that is so COOL&quot; features, this program&#39;s GUI is just enough to make my
        &quot;wow, i should have gotten this awhile ago&quot; list. the ability to see the services and the &quot;tree (see</p>
        <p>
        <a href="../../smiles/shock/eek2.gif" target="_blank">screenshot</a>) of the running processes, is also cool.</p>
        <p>Also ..&quot;Process Explorer also has a powerful search capability that will quickly show you which processes have
        particular handles opened or DLLs loaded. The unique capabilities of Process Explorer make it useful for tracking down
        DLL-version problems or handle leaks, and provide insight into the way Windows and applications work&quot;</p>
