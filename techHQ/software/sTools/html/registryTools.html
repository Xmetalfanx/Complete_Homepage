  <p>Before I begin, I am not for &quot;Run as many Registry Cleaners as you can&quot; or even it&#39;s a &quot;needed&quot; tasks
  for all users. These are just some options.</p>
  <p>As with all computer software, use at your own risk... just because I haven;t run into an issue with any of these programs,
  doesn&#39;t mean you will not... They can be powerful and dangerous (IF YOU DON&#39;T KNOW WHAT YOUR DOING). Do not take that
  that wrong way though ... most make it easy to restore (actually they all do) anything that it removes. You may want to start in
  Safe Mode and see how to restore items &quot;just in case&quot;... IF nothing goes wrong, your A-OK. (and 95% of the time this is
  the case); however, IF something does go wrong, you know how to restore the removed items and after 2 reboots (one in safe mode
  to restore then another back to &quot;Normal&quot; Windows) and a few simple steps (based on which Cleaner you use), your back to
  normal and your PC is OK again.</p>
  <p>If your not comfortable doing any registry cleaning, then DON&#39;T DO IT. Messing stuff up a little is how I learned all I
  know (well most) about computers, but some people really don&#39;t want to chance it and that&#39;s perfectly OK.</p>###Registry

      <p>This is something that you really dont have to do alot but if your computer is running sluggish, and its been a LONG time
      since you formatted or reinstalled a new version of Windows, you may want to give this a try.</p>
      <p>AGAIN, I have run into issues with NON-&quot;

      freewares too) that I have tried from Aulogic seem to work great.</p>
      <p>I did not notice any &quot;GREAT IMPROVEMENT&quot; in WIndows 7, after using this program, but it did remove (so it said)
      1.2MB from my registry.</p>

      <p>I do not recommend many registry cleaner; however, this is an exception. This is made by Auslogics which is the
      Defragmenting program I have been using for awhile now. I usually only use 
      <a href="http://www.macecraft.com/" target="_blank">JV16&#39;s Reg Cleaner</a>and it HAS been awhile since I ran that
      registry cleaner, but this one did find a few hundred entries .... it has been almost 36 hours since I have run this cleaner
      and I hace NO ILL EFFECTS. I have run registry &quot;cleaners&quot; before that remove a ton of entries (1/2 of them valid)
      and in some cases Windows is not able to boot afterwards. Best news is .. this is freeware too.</p>

      <p>Everyone seems to know CCleaner as the tempeorary file deleting program, but there is a Regisry Cleaning tool in CCleaner
      as well. (Click the &quot;Registry&quot; icon on the left under &quot;Cleaner&quot;.</p>
      <p>This doesn&#39;t remove alot of entries, but it does remove a good number of them. (After all, what good is &quot;My
      registry cleaner removes more entries than CCleaner!&quot; ?? If it removes too many entries and when you go to reboot, your
      computer will not start?</p>

      <p>(FREE or Pro available, though I use the very powerful free version)</p>
      <p>Some of the tasks this program can perform, are: Invalid Shortcut Fixer/Remover, Temp File Remover (scans whole HDD),
      Trace remover, Registry Cleaner, Start-up Manager, and most useful a new user (if you ask me) a 1-Click Maintenance feature
      that performs selected tasks automatically for the user.</p>
      <p>This registry cleaner (component) is (mind you that I dont compared &quot;entry to entry&quot; is along the lines of
      Auslogic&#39;s and Eusing&#39;s ... very good and I am not saying you need all 3 of these, though having this program
      provides you with many other tools then just a registry cleaner, so it doesnt hurt to try it.</p>

  This is by far the best registry cleaner I have come across. I will post a  full epinion (opinion) at epinion.com, as soon as
they are done with the maintenance on their  site. (I cant not post it until then). It will have details on this program
there.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  This is an overall system Tools program with start menu cleaner, registry cleaner, registry compactor (I have run into ALOT OF
issues with this on Vista and Windows 7, but Reg Compactor works 100% no issues on Windows XP), and many many more options.
  
  &lt;p class=&quot;maroonText&quot;&gt;HAVING SAID ALL THAT .. I wouldn&#39;t use this program if you are really new to computers
and dont know what your doing (unless your like me, years ago, and accept you can mess things up .. .but want to learn and test
stuff anyway). Dont get me wrong, this has only messed things up once or twice and thats when I and I alone selected &quot;too many
things&quot; to remove and even then .... rebooting into safe mode, restoring those items and then rebooting again, solved the
issue&lt;/p&gt;

  <p>Wise Registry Cleaner is another &quot;Wise&quot; product that I have recently tried and to be honest, It (like Wise Disk
  Cleaner) is not a replacement for some tools like &quot;JV16 Power Tools&quot; (which is not free, like this program is), though
  it has just enough features that are not in other freewares (at least &quot;all together in the same freeware&quot;, that makes
  this worth trying</p>

  &lt;li&gt;BOTH my 32bit XP and 64bit Windows 7 Machines had Wise Clean the registry and I
  selected the defaut entries Wise says are &quot;Safe&quot; to remove. I HAVE NOT experienced any
  ill effects of any kind on either machine&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;I am still testing this out, ... I dont expect a &quot;great improvement&quot;, though for
  someone who has never tweaked their computer.. this could help.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As with all programs like this, read what the &quot;tweak&quot; is doing before you do it or
  you may have strange results ... just &quot;read before your click&quot; is what I am saying.&lt;/li&gt;
