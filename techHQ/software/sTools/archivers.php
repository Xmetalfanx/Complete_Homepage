		<p>The more free programs I find, the more I wonder why people bother paying for programs like Winzip. I DO SUPPORT
		&quot;donating&quot; when you can to help the development of your favorite open source/free choice, AS WELL AS the fact that I
		am a big supporter of WinRar. IF there was a commercial (not free) program I&#39;d advice people buy in this category, it would
		be WinRar. While Winrar, doesn&#39;t have some of the &quot;advanced&quot; (ftp uploading/ backup scheduling)</p>

		<p>(Something I am looking into: For years I just assumed
		<span class="blue">7-Zip File Manager</span> , was the official 7-zip client (though I am sure 7-zip&#39;s compression format
		IS open source). I knew many other programs supported 7-zip, and was surprised that this week I found that other clients
		support some features of 7-zip, not even the newest alpha versions (Test of a Test version, basically) supported these same
		features (example - being able to add and remove files to an existing 7-zip file).</p>

		<p>I am NOT saying &quot;Dump

		<span class="blue">7-zip File Manager</span> , if you use it now&quot;. I CAN NOT STRESS THAT ENOUGH. I am just pointing out
		that even some of these lesser known compression programs such as PeaZip or HaoZip DO support some features that what I thought
		was the &quot;official 7 zip program&quot; does not.</p>

		<p>In other-words ... my point is ...
		<span class="italics">&quot;Hey .. if you have 7-zip File Manager... maybe you should try one of the others ... you may like it
		better&quot;</span> ... that&#39;s all</p>
