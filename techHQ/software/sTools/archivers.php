		<p>The more free programs I find, the more I wonder why people bother paying for programs like Winzip. I DO SUPPORT
		&quot;donating&quot; when you can to help the development of your favorite open source/free choice, AS WELL AS the fact that I
		am a big supporter of WinRar. IF there was a commercial (not free) program I&#39;d advice people buy in this category, it would
		be WinRar. While Winrar, doesn&#39;t have some of the &quot;advanced&quot; (ftp uploading/ backup scheduling)</p>

		<p>(Something I am looking into: For years I just assumed
		<span class="blue">7-Zip File Manager</span> , was the official 7-zip client (though I am sure 7-zip&#39;s compression format
		IS open source). I knew many other programs supported 7-zip, and was surprised that this week I found that other clients
		support some features of 7-zip, not even the newest alpha versions (Test of a Test version, basically) supported these same
		features (example - being able to add and remove files to an existing 7-zip file).</p>

		<p>I am NOT saying &quot;Dump

		<span class="blue">7-zip File Manager</span> , if you use it now&quot;. I CAN NOT STRESS THAT ENOUGH. I am just pointing out
		that even some of these lesser known compression programs such as PeaZip or HaoZip DO support some features that what I thought
		was the &quot;official 7 zip program&quot; does not.</p>

		<p>In other-words ... my point is ...
		<span class="italics">&quot;Hey .. if you have 7-zip File Manager... maybe you should try one of the others ... you may like it
		better&quot;</span> ... that&#39;s all</p>

            <p>This is a Chinease archiving program that I just saw posted about on a comment section, and I figured I would give it a
            chance ... man am I happy I did. Between performance and speed, this is VERY close to WinRar, and HaoZip is very well done
            if you ask me. HaoZip is my new favorite in this category, and I have only used it for half a day so far.</p>
            <p>When adding files to an archive (Interface wise ... it REALLY reminds me of WinRar)</p>

			<p class="boldCourier">Writes Zip and 7zip files AND .Kz which is a format only used in this program and it is SUPPOSE to
			be more compressed then zip and 7zip files.</p>
        
			<p>Comments: I have to say that I am not knocking .kz&#39;s format though it is NOT common and from the tests (just compressing	random items in  <span class="redtext">.zip, .7zip, and .kz</span> ... , .kz seemed to be about the same as either of the other	two formats  (speed compressing, AND size of compressed file).</p>

			<p>You DO NOT HAVE to use the .kz format, and I personally would advice against it, as almost all compression programs nowadays
			can read
			<span class="redtext">7zip and Zip</span> files, you can (whether your sending the files to someone else or you decide to
			switch compression/archiving programs later, you will save yourself some headaches.</p>
		 
			<p>
				<em>Ex - you have all your files in .kz compression files and then switch
				programs (to use everyday ... To find out that, the "new" program can not read .kz files.
			    </em>
			</p>

			<p>
				<em>
				
					With 7Zip or Zip, you may even switch/try new compression programs to
					your &amp;quot;heart&#39;s content&amp;quot; and none of them should have any
					issues reading or writing ZIP or 7ZIP files.

			<p>Comments: This is an old freeware I have known about for years, though I never really gave it a chance (I had chosen to
			use Power Archiver or Winrar). The more I mess around with it, the more I like it. I do have to say I like HaoZip best now
			(seems like a Winrar clone, though Winrar writes .RAR and .ZIP files ... HaoZip (and Peazip, for that matter) write .ZIP,
			.7zip, and a few linux formats that I know of (.tar.gz, .tar.bz2)</p>

        <p>The developer(s) of this program fully admit there might be problems and that its in the beta stages... I for one ..

			<p>One of the fastest programs to handle archives, that I have tried. This is the only program that can create RAR files.
