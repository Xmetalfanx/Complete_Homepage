  <p class="justify">The more free programs I find, the more I wonder why people bother paying for programs like Winzip.  I DO SUPPORT &quot;donating&quot; when you can to help the development of your favorite open source/free choice, AS WELL AS the fact that I am a big supporter of WinRar.  IF there was a commerical (not free) program i'd advice people buy in this catagory, it would be WinRar.  While Winrar, doesn't have some of the  &quot;advanced&quot; (ftp uploading/ backup scheduling

  <p class="justify">(Something I am looking into: For years I just assumed 
    <span class="blue">7-Zip File Manager
    </span> , was the offical 7zip client (though I am sure 7zip's compression format IS open source). I knew many other programs supported 7zip, and was suprised that this week I found that other clients support some features of 7zip, not even the newest alpha versions (Test of a Test version, basically) supported these same features (example - being able to add and remove files to an existing 7zip file). 
  </p>      
  <p class="justify">I am NOT saying &quot;Dump 
    <span class="blue">7-zip File Manager
    </span>, if you use it now&quot;. I CAN NOT STRESS THAT ENOUGH. I am just pointing out that even some of these lesser known compression programs such as PeaZip or HaoZip DO support some features that what I thought was the &quot;offical 7zip program&quot; does not. 
  </p>
  <p class="justify">In otherwords ... my point is ... 
    <span class="italics">&quot;Hey .. if you have 7zip File Manager... maybe you should try one of the others ... you may like it better&quot;

Between performance and speed, this is VERY close to WinRar, and HaoZip is very well done if you ask me.  HaoZip is my new favorite in this category, and I have only used it for half a day so far.

        <p>Comments: I have to say that I am not knocking .kz's format though it is NOT common and from the tests (just compressing random items in 
          <span class="redtext">.zip, .7zip, and .kz
          </span> ... , .kz seemed to be about the same as either of the other two formats (speed compressing, AND size of compressed file). 
        </p>          
        <p> You DO NOT HAVE to use the .kz format, and I personally would advice against it, as almost all compression programs nowadays can read 
          <span class="redtext">7zip and Zip
          </span> files, you can (whether your sending the files to someone else or you decide to switch compression/archiving programs later, you will save yourself some headaches.

        <p> Comments: This is an old freeware I have known about for years, though I never really gave it a chance (I had chosen to use Power Archiver or Winrar). The more I mess around with it, the more I like it. I do have to say I like HaoZip best now (seems like a Winrar clone, though Winrar writes .RAR and .ZIP files ... HaoZip (and Peazip, for that matter) write .ZIP, .7zip, and a few linux formats that I know of (.tar.gz, .tar.bz2)
