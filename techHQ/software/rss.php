    <p class="justify">So you have seen me add and comment on RSS, and do not know what it is or how to use it...</p>
    <p class="header">What are RSS Feeds, How do I read them? Do I need a special program for it? </p>
    <p class="justify">
    <img src="../smiles/funny/creator.gif" alt="Creator Smilie" width="65" height="82" class="centerImage" />You need a RSS reader, such as
    <a href="http://www.genghisgroup.com/" target="_blank">GreatNews</a> or <a href="http://www.genghisgroup.com/" target="_blank">&quot;Sharp Reader&quot; (Freeware)</a> .... </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="mainProgDescript">Most web-browsers that I have seen have added RSS &quot;support&quot; to read the content in say a sidebar (IE 7 I know, as well as Firefox 2.0x can read RSS feeds the way they are suppose to be seen). Personally I just like these freewares as they provide a little bit of increased &quot;control&quot; over how you can manage and view the feeds.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="justify">In short  RSS can take headlines and clips of text from various websites and send them to your RSS Reader, without even having to visit those websites.&nbsp; This allows you to grab headlines from your favorite sites (with RSS that is), and sort through the headlines you want to read, or the &quot;featured programs&quot; you want to take a look at. </p>
    <p class="justify">Since people do not have to load each site, and can put &quot;your&quot; RSS in a list of RSS Feeds they want to check, web traffic to your site may even increase when you add RSS feeds.&nbsp; Viewers can see product updates, or news along with the headlines of say &quot;Slashdot&quot; or &quot;Wired.com&quot;, which allows them to see your RSS Feed and to say &quot;hey ... i didn't know there was an update to that site too&quot;, or they make look at an artcle you wrote  and think &quot;hmm ... that's an interesting article&quot; and then go and read it, compared to having to visit a good number of sites and having to read each article one by own</p>
    <p class="header">Summary</p>
    <p class="justify">Some sites I know with RSS support are </p>
