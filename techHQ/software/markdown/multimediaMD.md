These are some of the programs I use often, though to be honest, this main page got out of hand (way too many programs) and I have divided the programs into sections (listed below in the links, or to the left under &quot;multimedia&quot;. This may mean more pages, but I think itis more organized then one page with say ...  30 programs of all different catagories


-	![GIMP Icon](../progIcons/graphics/91__gimp.png) [ GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/)
	
	Catagory: Graphics Editor
   

-	![Gom Player Icon]() [ GOM Player](http://www.gomlab.com)   

	Catagory: <span class="center">Media (Video) Player</span>

	One of my favorite video player ... tied with o VLC in my opinion.

-	![Foobar Icon](/techHQ/progIcons/media_players/foobar2000_v1_103.png) [ Foobar](http://www.foobar2000.org)  


	A media player that doesn't have a &quot;ton&quot; of features, but that may be exactly what some people want. 
	 
	This recently has become my audio player of Choice for daily use (in Windows)



-	![VLC Media Player Icon](/techHQ/progIcons/media_players/vlc_VLC_ICON.png) [ VLC Media Player](http://www.videoLAN.com)


	  <p>Catagory: Media Player</p>
	  
	A Great Multi-platform video (and audio too) media player,that is my favorite and the one I use daily 

	*Note; I have had strange issues with the 2.x family of VLC on some videos... (videos that play fine in GOM Player or even VLC 1.xxx) ... I am sure the programmer is still working out issues, so if this happens to you, please do not give up on VLC. I have tried many video players and VLC IS one of, (even not THE #1) best.*
	  
	The codecs need for most media players (if not already on one's computer) ... is included with the program... even in the portable versions.
