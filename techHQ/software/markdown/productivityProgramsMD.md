###Text Editors (more Basic)

 -	![AbiWord Icon](../progIcons/product/txtEditorIcons/AbiWord_10000.png) [AbiWord](http://www.abisource.com/)

      Good word processor that is a great option for someone who wants more than &quot;Notepad&quot; but may not want a full office suite. Definitely worth a look, if you ask me.
    
 -	![Editpad Lite Icon](../progIcons/product/txtEditorIcons/EditPad-Lite.gif) [Editpad Lite](http://www.editpadlite.com/)   
 
      
	  (see the basic description for <a href="#nl">Notetab Lite</a> )


-	[Notetab Lite](http://www.notetab.com)

      This is an Old program that hasn't been updated much over the years, but like Notepad++, it adds tabs (useful for those that don't want 100's of Notepad windows open) and many other useful text tools, that definitely makes this program worth a look.

	 <img src="../graphics/programs/notepad/npp.logo.80x15.png" alt="Notepad++" width="80" height="15" /></a>**
	 This is a Notepad replacement that will color code MANY types of code for easier readability. Many programmers would appreciate this, as its not a bloated Notepad replacement, but it just adds enough features that makes it more useful.


###PDF Creators 
 
 
 -	![Bullzip PDF Creator Icon](../progIcons/product/pdf/bullzip_PDF.png) [Bullzip PDF Printer]()

	This one I found via <a href="http://www.techsupportalert.com" target="_blank">TechSupport Alert's Site </a>and it does have a number of options, ... I still like doPDF alot but this is very nice and I see why they (though I do not agree with them 100%, I find they have good suggestions and in many many cases(program category wise) I do agree with the order of the list.. .so when they mention a &quot;program&quot; like this one and say its better than the ones I know about and use, ... I think the programs are worth a look.

   
-	![doPDF Icon](http://www.dopdf.com) [doPDF](../progIcons/product/pdf/dopdf_105.png)

	This one doesn't have a ton of options, though I find sometimes SIMPLE is better.  It is very fast on both of my laptops <span class="maroonText">(2.2GHz Dual core win7 64bit with 4GB of RAM,AND a &quot;2002&quot; XP 1.7GHZ with 768MB of RAM) </span>Some of the others can take a few seconds (about 10 I would say) to load and though that doesn't seem like much (and isn't a reason NOT to try the other options I list) and when you have a number of files to convert .. those seconds add up.
    
  -	![PDF Creator Icon](../progIcons/product/pdf/PDFCreator.gif) [PDF Creator](http://www.pdfforge.org/)  
     

    This is a recent find (as in the past 12 hours) ... Its open source and so far I like this best. Its a printer driver (like many other free PDF Creators) HOWEVER, I had <span class="redtext">PDF955 Free PDF Printer driver</span> which was &quot;OK&quot; but displayed a popup add for a few seconds every time you used it. Functional but annoying if you ask me ....
      
	This IS A HEFTY 16MB which I believe includes GhostScript ( Even I am not sure what this is) and is needed to run this program. I rather this be the case then to have a @ 2MB download and have to go hunt down GhostScript manually.
  
##PDF Viewers/readers
   

   
-	![Foxit Icon](../progIcons/product/pdf/Foxit Reader_128.png) [FoxIT Reader](http://www.foxitsoftware.com/)

    **<a href="http://www.foxitsoftware.com/" target="_blank">
	<img src="../graphics/programs/foxit_logo.gif" alt="Foxit PDF Reader" width="141" height="45" class="imgleft" /></a>** This is a free PDF Reading Program that overall, I believe is about 2 MB as opposed to   Adobe Reader's 10-30 MB ..
    
	This has many features a program like SumatraPDF does NOT HAVE, however, it seems to have gotten &quot;bloated&quot;
      </div>

   
-	![PDF-XChange Viewer](../progIcons/product/pdf/PDFXCview_128.png) [PDF-XChange Viewer](http://www.pdfxviewer.com/)

	<ul>
      <li>This one I just started using and I am shocked by how useful it is. </li>
      <li>Although you can save the original PDF (Over-write it) ... I choose to make a copy ... its simple to undo a highlight or other form of edit (just basically click the highlighted area... a box comes up and you can right click and hit &quot;delete&quot; ... but I don't want to mess with the original ... just in case &quot;something goes wrong&quot;</li>
      <li>THIS DOESN'T ALLOW YOU TO TYPE A DOCUMENT AND SAFE THAT AS A PDF... Freeware Print drivers (document ~~&gt; PDF) are available as well as some functionality to save PDF files in Open Office </li>
    </ul>
	
	
-	![SumatraPDF Reader](../progIcons/product/pdf/SumatraPDF_1.png) [SumatraPDF](http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf)	

	
      <div class="progTableDesc">
        <p>SumatraPDF is  even smaller than Foxit's Reader and one I have found myself using all the time. I do not think there is any reason to not have (or at least try) both Foxit Reader and SumatraPDF</p>
        <p> I love this program</p>
        <p>I just found out that it not only reads PDF files, but also MODI, and EPUB E-book format files too ... AND its just as light on resources as ever.</p>

###Office Suites
    
-	![Open Office Icon](../progIcons/product/soffice_25.png) [(Apache) Open Office](http://www.openoffice.org)
	   
      
    <a href="http://www.openoffice.org">
	  <img src="../graphics/programs/OOo_logo_snowing.gif" alt="Open Office Logo" width="184" height="50" class="left" />
	</a>
			
    This is a COMPLETELY FREE alternative to Microsoft's Office Suite. It  may not have all the &quot;bells and whistles&quot; that MS Office has (note: my view, is if you cant figure out what those features are, then you probably &quot;didn't need&quot; them anyway), AND Open Office (like Libre Office) is 100% Free, though there may be a small charge for cooperate environments.
        
	Products included
     <ul>
       <li>Word Processor </li>
       <li>Spreadsheet</li>
       <li>&quot;Math&quot; Program</li>
       <li>Presentation Program</li>
     </ul>
       
	(September 2012): No Longer associated with Oracle, and a product of Apache, meaning it is once again Open Sources and being regularly updated once again, after a year of &quot;being stuck&quot; with no updates from Oracle</p>
       
	 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       
	*** October 2012 Open Office/Libre Office Note: ***
       
	The speed of both programs and the functioning have GREATLY improved in recent releases.
       
	I can not say how they open and look like IN Microsoft Office 2010 and above, though many of the new formats (DOCX for example) can now be read/written with the newest versions of Open/Libre Office and they seem to work fine, but I can't confirm.

  
-	[Kingsoft Office</span> / WPS Office](http://wps.com/wps-office-personal/)

    This is a recent (Oct 2012) find and a fine alternative to Microsoft Office. The Pro version has a Ribbon style interface, though the Free version does not.
    
    Kingsoft Office (currently) is (Free edition) 39.x MB and it contains a:
    <ul>
      <li>Word Processor</li>
      <li>Spreadsheet</li>
      <li>and Presentation </li>
    </ul>
    
    I do notice it does seem to have trouble reading some supported formats (for now) and it DOES NOT read &quot;Open/Libre&quot; formats, though it seems to read all Microsoft Office formats (including MS Office 2007 and 2010) 

-	![Libre Office Icon](../progIcons/product/libreIcons/LibO_3_103.png) [Libre Office](http://www.libreoffice.org/)

    Libre Office while not as well known as Open Office, was programmed by the same developers as the original Open Office (pre-Oracle .. 3.1 is the number, if I am not mistaking)  it seems to have had to do with Oracle buying Sun Microsystem who &quot;own the rights&quot; to Open Office and wanting (Oracle) more control of Open Office and wanting to do away with (I cant confirm this 100% at the time i am typing this) all future free versions to make it a commercial program.
     
	The whole idea of Open Source is NOT to have one company in control of the project ï¿½ former Open Office developers branched out again using the code they made for the last &quot; pre-Oracle &quot; Open Office and made Libre Office, which is always being updated.
     
	***Notes on 3.60 and the latest, 3.61 (at the time this is being typed up)***: I am amazed at how fast this program seems to be getting. There are (read the official changelog/release notes for more information) a few added features (support to read/write .docx files, I believe is one) in newer versions, though THE MOST NOTICABLE TO ME, <span class="blue">[same as new releases of &quot;The GIMP&quot; Graphics Program]</span> is the speed. The first time (even if installing over an existing install of Libre Office) may take a few extra seconds to load, though, after that Libre Office developers have focused on PERFORMANCE.
     
	The developers of Libre (and to be honest Apache developers of &quot;Open Office&quot;) have focused on adding needed features, and mainly from what I see, on performances and I am amazed at how fast Libre and Open Office have gotten in recent releases. 
      
	 This (the fact these two office suites were &quot;too slow&quot; for some people) was one of the only criticism </p>

- 	![Text Crawler Icon](../progIcons/product/TextCrawler_32512.png) [Text Crawler](http://www.digitalvolcano.co.uk/)

	GREAT tool to search and perform various functions on large amounts of text files. Here are just some of the things you can do with Text Crawler
    
	<ul>
        <li> Finding and Replacing text in even as much as a directory (or certain files in a directory) </li>
        <li>Searching an entire subdirectory for a set pattern (including regular expressions)</li>
    </ul>
  
-	[Universal Viewer](http://atorg.net.ru/universal_viewer/)

	This program is a context menu (right click on an icon) option that allows you to view many application's files without having to have that program be installed ... I DON'T THINK this would work on many audio/video formats (an alternative to codecs) ... but it may work for graphics formats.
