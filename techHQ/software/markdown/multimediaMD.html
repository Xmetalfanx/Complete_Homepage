<p>These are some of the programs I use often, though to be honest, this main page got out of hand (way too many programs) and I have divided the programs into sections (listed below in the links, or to the left under &quot;multimedia&quot;. This may mean more pages, but I think it is more organized then one page with say ...  30 programs of all different categories</p>

    <p>A media player that doesn't have a &quot;ton&quot; of features, but that may be exactly what some people want. </p>

    <p>A Great Multi-platform video (and audio too) media player,that is my favorite and the one I use daily </p>
    <p><em>Note; I have had strange issues with the 2.x family of VLC on some videos... (videos that play fine in GOM Player or even VLC 1.xxx) ... I am sure the programmer is still working out issues, so if this happens to you, please do not give up on VLC. I have tried many video players and VLC IS one of, (even not THE #1) best.</em></p>
    <p>The codecs need for most media players (if not already on one's computer) ... is included with the program... even in the portable versions.</p>
