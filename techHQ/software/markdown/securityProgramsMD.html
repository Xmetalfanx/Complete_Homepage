    <p>This Encryption Program can create encrypted &quot;virtual drives&quot; and even hidden drives inside of the encrypted volume. This is a must try an apparently &quot;will ALWAYS BE FREEWARE&quot; ... MANY ENCRYPTION ALGORITHMS ARE AVAILABLE AS WELL </p>
    <p><span class="quoted"> TrueCrypt is a software system for establishing and maintaining an on-the-fly-encrypted volume (data storage device). On-the-fly encryption means that data are automatically encrypted or decrypted right before they are loaded or saved, without any user intervention. No data stored on an encrypted volume can be read (decrypted) without using the correct password/keyfile(s) or correct encryption keys. Entire file system is encrypted (e.g.., file names, folder names, contents of every file, free space, meta data, etc). </span></p>

    <p class="redtext">&quot;This application disables several parts of Windows that can be exploited by malicious websites to silently install Malware on your system, preventing it from ever installing.&quot; </p>
    <p>
    <p class="redtext"><strong>NOTE</strong>: These are only TEMPORARY fixes. Certain parts of Windows that use these objects may not function properly after they have been disabled. Please apply the patches corresponding to these exploits A.S.A.P. when Microsoft releases them.</p>

    <p>Spyware Blaster works in a different way then other anti-spyware programs.  You don\'t necessarily have to have a spyware program installed in your system to download spyware. In some cases (ones that I just found out for myself), webmasters have become more creative in creating websites where all you have to do is visit the &quot;infected&quot; 
      website to get spyware. Spyware Blaster install &quot;kill bit&quot; that prevents the active-x Spyware from even installing in the first place. This is CONSTANTLY being updated. I w0uld not use this alone, however... 	I use this jointly with Spybot, and found that the creators  of Spybot have added features to help tie these two programs &quot;together&quot;.</p>

    <p class="redBold">Second best Anti-spyware scanner, next to Malware Bytets, if you ask me. This program, even I sometime, 
      forget. </p>
    <p class="redBold">This is very unfortunate, since I would consider this a &quot;must have&quot; programs </p>

    <p>Security Program for Windows XP that will set some unsecured settings in XP. Its freeware and I RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERY XP USER. These Settings can be done manually, but for everyone ... especially the people that don't know how... this makes it a pretty much .. .1 step process</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Some Items It sets are:
        <ul>
          <li>Media Player Options</li>
          <li>WPA (Product Activation)</li>
          <li>Error Reporting (how windows always wants to tell Microsoft every time a program crashes) </li>
        </ul>
        Windows Services
        <ul>
          <li>Internet Explorer Settings</li>
          <li>.. and more .</li>

    <p>(Note: WATCH WHAT YOU ENABLE AND DISABLE ... its very easy to change back if there is trouble, but some settings may disable functions you don't want disabled ... I for instance disabled the printer spool, by mistake and couldn't print ... going back to services.msc and setting the the printer service back to start and automatic.. it was fixed ) </p>
   
    <p>This is a program similar to <a href="/techHQ/optAndTweak/id3tags.php">Bugoff</a> or <a href="/techHQ/optAndTweak/id3tags.php">XP-Antispy</a>. This adjust some system settings and services to make your computer more secure. Since this is from <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">SourceForge, its Open Source </a>so you know there is no spyware (OS = Freewares where the source code is available to anyone to work on and develop add-ons/fixes for) </p>

    MalwareBytes</a></p>
  
      <p>My Favorite Spyware/Malware scanner.</p>
      <p>As anyone real person who does tech support (even as a hobby) and your'll find that in some way or another (say on a BOOT CD) Malwarebytes is a must-have tool for them and one program they wouldn't do without</p>

    <p>

<h3>Specialty Programs - Programs that do not quiet fit 100% into other categories</h3>

    <p><img src="/techHQ/progIcons/security/TDSSKiller_128.png" alt="Kaspersky Antivirus" /> <a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/virus-removal/remove-tdss-tdl3-alureon-rootkit-using-tdsskiller">Kaspersky's TDSSKiller</a></p>
    <p>From Kaspersky, this gets rid of the first part of the very common &quot;Google Redirect&quot; infection, and like Combofix, Malwarebytes, and Rkill a must have for any recovery CD or Flash drive as an added option to get rid of specific infections from infected computers.</p>
    <p>Note: I hope to have a better, more accurate URL link shortly</p>

    <p><img src="/techHQ/progIcons/security/malware/ComboFix_100.png" alt="Combofix Icon" /> <a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/combofix/how-to-use-combofix">Combofix</a></p>
    <p>This is a &quot;use at your own risk&quot; product, that I have used a few times and seen it work on a system of mine that 
      wouldn't even boot into safe mode.</p>
    <p>I want to say that although this CAN ... it is no guarantee that it will get rid get rid of an infection 100%. What I mean is that after you run Combofix and get back into Windows, it is a good idea to do a scan with Super Antispyware/Malwarebyres and your antivirus too.</p>
    <p>That computer I mentioned I used Combofix on, was in trouble and I thought<span class="maroonText"> (despite some who recommend Reformatting, WHEVER there is a problem, I AM NOT ONE OF THEM.. ONLY when I have (or a user who I am advising) has no other choice) </span>I would be forced to reformat.. Ever since then I recommend Combofix for badly infected machines, though if nothing is going wrong, and you THINK you have an infection ... 
      a simple malware scan (Malwarebytes or SuperAntispyware) and Antivirus scan would be the better way to go. </p>

    <p><img src="../progIcons/security/malware/rkill_100.png" alt="Rkill Icon" /> <a href="http://preview.tinyurl.com/2dnzgjf">RKill</a></p>
    <p>Though I admit the name and &quot;Rkill.exe&quot; single EXE file itself seems to be itself like an infection, 	this is a must-have for any tech (or any common users) toolkit. I have seen MANY &quot;Fake Antivirus&quot; or &quot;Fake Malware scanners&quot; out and the removal instructions for ALL of them invloved the following general steps</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="navyText"> Boot into Safe Mode</li>
      <li class="navyText">Run Rkill (AND DO NOT REBOOT)</li>
      <li class="navyText">NOW run MalwareBytes (if MB is ran before Rkill, it will not remove the infection. 
        This is called the root kit part of the infection that Rkill is removing/disabling</li>
      <li class="navyText">Reboot</li>
      <li>(and a follow-up scan is a good idea, &quot;just to double check&quot; your infection free </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>
