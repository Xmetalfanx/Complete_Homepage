##&quot;What is a &quot;file manager&quot; and why do I care, Xmetal?&quot;
        
Good question: A File Manager controls how you interact with the folders and files on your computer. I (just my opinion) find Microsoft's Windows Explorer (some know this as the &quot;My Computer&quot; program they see when pressing the &quot;My Computer&quot; icon). Here you can see the hierarchy of folders and files on your computer. Some people think that what comes with the Windows Operating System is the only choice. NOT TRUE. 

All of these choice, have positives and negatives, and I advice you to look at each and after awhile, you can see which one works best for you. I think that the way (example) the way Windows Explorer is setup in a bit confusing for new users, in say Vista compared to XP. Some of these file managers I list, solve issues and make navigating your files much easier.
       
###Files Managers Software
My top picks: 
       
- [**XYplorer***](http://www.xyplorer.com/) and Free Commander (both have 100% free versions)
	- I am not saying do not get the pro (paid) version of XYPlorer... I just think the Free version is jam packed with features as-is
          
	- Both of these I have used regularly and they make my life alot easier than with the file/folder manager that comes with Windows
           
- ![Directory Opus Icon](../progIcons/system_tools/fileManagers/dopus_100.png) [**Directory Opus**](http://www.gpsoft.com.au/)
	- (not free and to be honest, many of the freewares that lacked some Directory Opus &quot;features&quot; are gaining those features version by version (update).         
          
	- This (though not free), is MY FAVORITE... The GUI (Graphic Interface) is just a tad nicer then other file managers, and like I said before, although it doesn't have any ![Shocked Smile](../smiles/shock/shocked10.gif) 'wow' features&quot;, though, the way it packages common features of a file manager together just looks (and more importantly... WORKS ) really well in this application</div>

	<div class="progTableDesc">A good freeware choice that is getting better/adding features version by version. </div>

**Comment: ** I have known about Explorer++, XYPlorer, Total Commander, Directory Opus, and even Xplorer2 for awhile now, though this one is new to me. I have to say that I love it



	- Total Commander

<div class="progTableDesc"> LOTS of plugins, but still it looks a bit &quot;Windows 3.1ish&quot; to me... Alot of people love that about it and find this to be better than Directory Opus <img src="../smiles/various/dont-know.gif" alt="&quot;Don't Know&quot;" width="30" height="20" /></div>

- ![Xplorer2](../progIcons/system_tools/fileManagers/xplorer2_64_128.png) [Xplorer2](http://www.zabkat.com/)
        
	(Note: comments here are based on the Free version)
	This may be one of the nicer free file managers that makes navigating your computer very easy, though many advanced features are in the pro version only. This is one of the top picks (Free version) if you ask me.

**Comments**: This has always been &quot;OK&quot; to me, though XYPlorer is one I recently upgraded and BOY WAS I SHOCKED. The minor issues (really just &quot;I wish it had this or .. did that&quot;, not problems) I had with it, are one hundred percent GONE now. I use to think Directory Opus was so much better, .. .now I can not say that any longer.

There IS a free (very good) version and a Pro version
