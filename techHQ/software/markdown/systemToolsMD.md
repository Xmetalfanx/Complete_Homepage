These are more of a variety of &quot;System Tools&quot; freewares.  The list was getting too long, so I moved many of them to the System Tools &quot;Subpages&quot;, listed to the left.  If there is a well known freeware not listed on this page, odds are its in one of the subpages.     

###General System Tools 
      
-	![Vista Start Menu ](../progIcons/system_tools/VistaStartMenu_AINICON.png )  [7 Start Menu ] (http://www.startmenu7.com )

	Changes to a better looking and more managable Start Menu in Windows 7 ... there are also &quot;Classic Start Menu&quot; and &quot;Vista Start Menu&quot;  programs avaible from the same developer.

-	![World TIme Sync Icon ](../progIcons/system_tools/world_time_server_logo.png )  [Atomic Clock Sync ] (http://www.worldtimeserver.com/atomic-clock/ )

	A Simple (one that actually works) Time Sync Program. I have tried many other options, but this is the only one that I found to really work ...            grant it that you\'ll (if your PC is not having trouble) only use it one time every say .. 8-12 months maybe, but still ... it works

-	[Dexpot] (http://www.dexpot.de/)

	This is the program (type) I have been looking for. It is a FREEware that allows you to have mulitple virtual desktops that you can switch between. This program is HIGHLY customizable, and to be honest, I am still playing with all the options. 

	There HAVE BEEN free programs like this in the past that didn't offer all the features, that I had been looking for. Also there have been programs (I can not recall the name) that had the functions and features, though were  priced at $29.99 or higher. This is a great little tool I plan to mess around with more in the coming days.</div>

  

-	![Duplicate Cleaner Icon ](../progIcons/system_tools/DuplicateCleaner_setup_103.png )  [Duplicate  Cleaner ] (http://www.digitalvolcano.co.uk/content/duplicate-cleaner )

    Great tool for Finding duplicate files of any type ... on my data hard drives (no programs or Operating Systems), I find myself using this often.
  
-	![Event Log Explorer ](../progIcons/system_tools/1833__Eventlogexplorer_icon.png )  [Event Log Explorer ] (http://www.eventlogxp.com/ )


    A simple program that has some filtering features for Administrators to view Window 2000 (and higher) \'s Event log.&nbsp; 
          
    Not to say &quot;Oh my God, the viewer, built into Windows is SO HARD to use&quot;; however, little additions (like right clicking an error and being able to:
     
    A) search google for that error/fix for that error or 
    B) Go directly to the MS Knowledge base for a description (hey .. its an error being reported by MS anyway, eh?) </span>have made this program catch my eye, the moment I tried it

-	![Fast Explorer Icon ](../progIcons/system_tools/FastExplorer_DEFAULT.png )  [Fast Explorer &quot;2008&quot; ] (http://thesoftpro.tripod.com )  
        
	Allows you to manage the context (right click) menu better and to remove un-wanted entries that are sometimes hard to remove (even if you want to KEEP the actual program). 
     
	I would look in the program (in &quot;question&quot; 's ) preferences or Options menu first .. but even with that ... I have found this program to be very useful.

-	![File Association Fixer Icon ](../progIcons/system_tools/File_Association_Fixer_32512.png )  [File Association Fixer

-	![FileMenu Tools Icon ](../progIcons/system_tools/FileMenuTools_1075.png)  [File-Menu Tools ] (http://www.lopesoft.com/ )
	
	Adds many needed entries to the Windows Contect Menu. There are many tools like this; however, I consider this one the best one I have tried so far.
 
-	![God Mode Creator ](../progIcons/system_tools/GodMode_Creator_32512.png )  [Godmode Creato ] (http://www.thewindowsclub.com/ )

	This allows you to access &quot;God Mode&quot; (a mode that gives you access to changing specific settings, options, and information &quot;hidden&quot; by Microsoft.
 
	This is made for Windows Vista and Windows 7


-	![Quick Restore Maker ](../progIcons/system_tools/QuickRestoreMaker_32512.png )  [Quick Retore Maker ] (http://www.thewindowsclub.com/create-a-system-restore-point-in-1-click-with-quick-restore-maker )

-	![TrayIT Icon ](../progIcons/system_tools/TrayIt!_101.png )  [TrayIt ] (http://www.teamcti.com/trayit/trayit.htm )

	The best &quot;Send to the system tray&quot; program I have found so far. Small and Effective. Works fine on my Windows 7 64bit OS too.

-	![TreeView Free ](../progIcons/system_tools/TreeSize_MAINICON.png )  [Tree View Freeware Ed. ] (http://www.jam-software.com/freeware/)

	View your drive and folder sizes in various graphs to determine what folders are taking up the most space. I have used TreeView for a long time and I love this program.

-	![Unlocker Icon ](../progIcons/security/Unlocker_106.png )  [UNLOCKER ] (http://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=Unlockerfreeware )

	Frustrated by &quot;Can not delete&quot; and &quot;File Currently in use&quot; even though you are sure it shouldn't be?... this is a freeware, that in my opinion, the best program for unlocking the file, or canceling the specific process that says its using that file.
