                <p>Licence: not freeware</p>
                <p>Offline Explorer is the next generation of off-line browser. It combines flexibility, power and ease of ''use'' in a tightly-coded package with all the features needed in an off-line browser.</p>
                <p>(from Offine Explorer Help File)</p><a href="http://www.tenmax.com/teleport/pro/home.htm">Teleport Pro</a>
                <p>Part Swiss Army knife, part chainsaw, Teleport Pro is a fully automated, multithreaded, link-following, file-retrieving webspider. It will retrieve all the files you want — and only the files you want — from any part of the Internet. Teleport Pro can also completely download a website, enabling you to “offline browse” the site at much greater speeds than if you were to browse the site online. Create an exact duplicate, or “mirror” of a website, complete with subdirectory structure and all required files. Search a website for files of a certain type (and size). Automatically download a list of files from the Internet. Explore every website linked from a central website search a website for keywords. Make a list of all pages and files on a website. No more waiting for slow pages to download. No more clicking on links for hours, only to find garbage at the end of your trail. Teleport can completely automate your website searching, mirroring, publishing, and downloading tasks.</p>
