				<p>Part Swiss Army knife, part chainsaw, Teleport Pro is a fully automated, multithreaded, link-following, file-retrieving webspider. It will retrieve all the files you want — and only the files you want — from any part of the Internet. Teleport Pro can also</p>
				<p>Completely download a website, enabling you to “offline browse” the site at much greater speeds than if you were to browse the site online.  Create an exact duplicate, or “mirror” of a website, complete with subdirectory structure and all required files.  Search a website for files of a certain type (and size).  Automatically download a list of files from the Internet.  Explore every website linked from a central website</p>
				<p>Search a website for keywords. Make a list of all pages and files on a website.</p>
				<p>No more waiting for slow pages to download. No more clicking on links for hours, only to find garbage at the end of your trail. Teleport can completely automate your website searching, mirroring, publishing, and downloading tasks.</p>

			</p>
		  </li>
		  <li>
			<p class="title">
				<a href="http://www.freedownloadmanager.org/"> Free Download Manager</a>
			</p>

			<p class="description">These are all good choices, and free (no spyware or any of that)
			  Note: these are more to &quot;manage&quot; downloads and although these are good for &quot;resuming&quot;
			  downloads if you need it too ... These will not &quot;double your download speed&quot;</p>
		  </li>
		</ul>


		<h2>Misc Internet Programs</h2>
		<ul>
		  <li>
			<p class="title">
			<a href="http://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/active_ports.html">Active Ports </a>
			</p>

			<p class="description">This is a sort of Graphical &quot;Netstat&quot; that shows what ports are open, local
			information (the local IP address and port information) as well as the remote port information and what process
			 is using them</p>
		  </li>

		  <li>
			<p class="title">
				<a href="http://robspangler.com/blog/encrypt-mailto-links-to-stop-email-spam/">MailTo-Encrypter</a>
			</p>

			<p class="description">This will give you a replacement HTML code for your e-mail on your site. The e-mail will
			still be sent to your address, but this will allow you to protect yourself from slammers, who collect mass e-mail
			addresses from as my sites as it can (they are programs), and adds them to junk e-mail lists</p>
		  </li>
		  <li>
			<p class="title">
				<a href="https://www.donationcoder.com/Software/Mouser/urlsnooper/"> <strong>URL Snooper</strong> </a>
			</p>

			<p>This program is a solution for getting the URLs to those pesky media streams that hide the URL in a ton of code. This can allow you to download a stream to playback later (especially useful for those that do not have high-speed access)</p>

		<h2>E-mail/POP3 Clients and E-mail Related Programs</h2>

				<img src="/techHQ/progIcons/internet/thunderbird.png" alt="Mozilla Thunderbird Icon " />
				<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/" target="_blank">Mozilla Thunderbird</a>

		  </li>
		  <li>
			<p class="title">
			<a href="http://www.pmail.com/"> Pegasus E-mail </a>
			</p>


			<p class="description">Pegasus Mail is free software for reading e-mail ... not the best GUI for some people,
			but I don\'t mind... you can also setup some pretty good spam filters with various rulesets.
			</p>

			<div class="description">
			<p>Ad Blocker for almost all internet apps - including applications like Paltalk - </p>
			<p>Otherwise, if you don\'t mind paying for it, its one of the top (beside Adblock for Firefox only) ad/element
			blockers out there. If i regularly used browsers other than Firefox, I\'d have this as a &quot;must have&quot;</p>
