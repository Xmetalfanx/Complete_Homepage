  | These are more of a variety of &quot;System Tools&quot; freewares.  The list was getting too long, so I moved many of them to the System Tools &quot;Subpages&quot;, listed to the left.  If there is a well known freeware not listed on this page, odds are its in one of the subpages.

  .panel-body
    p
    | A Simple (one that actually works) Time Sync Program. I have tried many other options, but this is the only one that I found to really work ... grant it, that you\&apos;ll (if your PC is not having trouble) only use it one time every say .. 8-12 months maybe, but still ... it works

  .panel-body
    p
      | This is the program (type) I have been looking for. It is a FREEware that allows you to have multiple virtual desktops that you can switch between. This program is HIGHLY customizable, and to be honest, I am still playing with all the options.
    | &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;
    p
      | There HAVE BEEN free programs like this in the past that didn&apos;t offer all the features, that I had been looking for. Also there have been programs (I can not recall the name) that had the functions and features, though were  priced at $29.99 or higher. This is a great little tool I plan to mess around with more in the coming days.

  p
    | A) search Google for that error/fix for that error or
    | B) Go directly to the MS Knowledge base for a description (hey .. its an error being reported by MS anyway, eh?) have made this program catch my eye, the moment I tried it

  p
    | Allows you to manage the context (right click) menu better and to remove un-wanted entries that are sometimes hard to remove (even if you want to KEEP the actual program).
  p
    | I would look in the program (in &quot;question&quot; &apos;s ) preferences or Options menu first .. but even with that ... I have found this program to be very useful.
