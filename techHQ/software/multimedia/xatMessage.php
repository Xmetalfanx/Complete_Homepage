        <p class="justify">
          This is quickly becoming one of my &quot;must have&quot; programs...
          The program can handle JPG, Gifs, PNGs, and Tiffs. You can also do
          all of the above &quot;batchly&quot; meaning you don't have to edit
          files one by one.... you can do it folder by folder, although i would
          not recommend using the image enhancer options... just by re-saving
          some of the images on my site, and nothing else with this program,
          some of them where cut in half some EVEN more then a 75% reduction in
          size...same format, same compression. Esp if your a webmaster or just
          have a large collection of photos on your computer... Try this. not
          freeware, but very good non-the-less.
