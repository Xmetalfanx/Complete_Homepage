			<p>I will be honest, that this is one I had used YEAAAAAAAAAAARS ago, and recognized the name instantly.. (though i can not

			just forgot about it and never looked for new versions.</p>
			<p>I have been &quot;Playing with&quot; (editor/Viewer/Batch Editor/...etc etc) program for a bit now, and I am shocked at
			how well it works .. I am not saying I am &quot;dumping&quot; any other program, but instead ADDING this tool to my
			collection. Very well done</p>

			<p>This tool IS GREAT. Unlike alot of other programs that will just say compress a file more, this program can reduce the
			size of an image without lowering quality. You can also batch. You can use color correction to fix images (although i have
			found this doesn&#39;t always work 100% on all image), crop images, sharpen then and reduce the noise and artifacts in an
			image, as well as fixing the histogram (brightness and contrast).</p>
