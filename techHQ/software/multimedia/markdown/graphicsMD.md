	Image viewer with some basic editing features. that is really not too bad ... personally I like Xnview better but that is just a personal preference. 
       
	I have even installed an older version of FIV (I am re-trying it) and it seems better than what I remember

	Multi-platform FREEWARE that is very comparable to Adobe Photoshop Elements or Paint Shop Pro for many (but maybe not all) editing features.'
	       
	<span class="underlineBold">Comments: </span>I never dis-liked this program, but have not used as it as much as I have found myself using this great program lately. This is getting to be a &quot;Must have&quot; no matter what Windows or Linux Operating System you use, for me
	       
	IF you are looking for a powerful photoshop-esk program to edit graphics with, The GIMP is for you

	Freeware Vector Graphics program that contains MANY features 
	        
	This one I downloaded to do basic editing with a group of Freewares in Ubuntu Linux 11.04. and saw that there was a portable version for Windows was just updated, so I downloaded it and figured &quot;I will try it later&quot; ... wow .. this is exactly what i needed, and didn't even know to look for this program.
	       
	There are so many features, you can do with this proigram and to be honest, I am still &quot;playing&quot; with it, and am learning them as I go.
	       
	This is a &quot;Must Try&quot; if you ask me.

     DEFINITELY WORTH A TRY


-	![Photoscape Icon](../../progIcons/graphics/PhotoScape_128.png)   [PhotoScape](http://www.photoscape.org/)

    I will be honest, that this is one I had used YEAAAAAAAAAAARS ago, and recognized the name instantly.. (though i can not recall why I stopped using it)... I think during an Windows 98 to XP type upgrade it had trouble with the upgrade and I just forgot about it and never looked for new versions.
       
	I have been &quot;Playing with&quot; (editor/Viewer/Batch Editor/...etc etc) program for a bit now, and I am shocked at how well it works .. I am not saying I am &quot;dumping&quot; any other program, but instead ADDING this tool to my collection.  Very well done
      

-	![Picasa Icon](../../progIcons/graphics/picasa.gif)   [Picasa](http://picasa.google.com/)   
  
      Google's Graphics Editing and Organization Program.. This greatly impressed me.
      There are better chooses for editing... but for organization of your images... this is AT LEAST worth a try for everyone

-	[PixScan Lite](http://www.pixscan2000.com/pslite.html)

      
  	Scans Directories for multiple graphics formats, searching for multiple instances of the same image. This DOES NOT look at the file name, but the image itself. This can be VERY useful.(above is old GUI) but it still works fine..
      
  	Below is a screenshot of a &quot;harder to find&quot; <img src="../../smiles/funny/attention.gif" alt="attention smile" width="88" height="78" />version...mainly because the program's website is down and doesn't seem to be coming back)...   if you can find it on P2P or a site like Softpedia.com, or Snapfile.com and stumble across the installer for version 3 (below) .. .feel lucky... it took me awhile.

-	![XnView Icon](../../progIcons/graphics/XnView.png)   [XnView](http://www.xnview.com/)
 
     A Freeware Graphics Viewer, Organizer, and Editor. I use this ALL the time, and is a great program to have installed. In my opinion, this one is a <span class="boldText">must</span> have.

    This tool IS GREAT. Unlike alot of other programs that will just say compress a file more, this program can reduce the size of an image without lowering quality. You can also batch. You can use color correction to fix images (although i have found this doesn't always work 100% on all image), crop images, sharpen then and reduce the noise and artifacts in an image, as well as fixing the histogram (brightness and contrast).
