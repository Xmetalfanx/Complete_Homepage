	Adjusts volume on mp3s so there is not one really loud one and one you have to turn the volume up to hear. 
	           
	*COMMENT:* I am not saying this program is not that good... but I personally like &quot;Mp3Trim (pro)&quot; better. mp3s I adjust with Mp3 Gain seems to be a tad off (volume and overall sound) afterwards
      
      
-	[Mp3nity](http://www.littlelan.com/mp3nity)

	Not the prettiest, but a very decent ID3 editor that can lookup tags, Cover Images, and Lyrics ... I have had alot of programs (like Winamp) return very odd results, UNRELATED to what the mp3 actually is ..
	
	Mp3nity while it could use some interface work .. .it does really well. I am impressed
      
     
  
- ![Tag Scan Icon](/techHQ/progIcons/media/Tagscan_MAINICON.png)  [Tag Scan](http://www.xdlab.ru/en/index.htm)

	One of the best freeware Id3 tag Editor there is, in my opinion. Must faster and easier to use then others 
  
     
##Audio Rippers - Freewares

-	[Audio Grabber](http://www.audiograbber.com-us.net/) 

	You want a good, FREE Mp3 Encoder, Ripper, and Decoder? This is your program. I will say that it is not as fast as &copy;Xing's Audio Catalyst or MusicMatch, but it is still great. You can read my &quot;epinion&quot; on Cdexx here: <a href= "http://www.epinions.com/./cmd-review-5995-B605AE8-3A3833C0-prod1"> My &quot;Epinion&quot; on CDEX</a>
     

-	![]()  [Exact Audio Copy](http://www.exactaudiocopy.de/) 

	CD Ripper, and tag editor that supports MANY codecs. This in many ways is comparable to CDexx
    
	*This is the one I have been using constantly on Windows now*


##Audio Programs - Shareware

    <div class="progTablesName"><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/audition/" target="_blank">Adobe Audition <em> (formerly.&quot;Cool Edit&quot;)</em></a></div>


	&quot;Cool Edit 2000, the most powerful and easy to use digital audio recorder, editor, and mixer available&quot; 
	         
	Adobe has purchased and renamed Cool Edit &quot;Adobe Auditon&quot;
	      

-	[Clickfix](http://www.jdklein.com/clickfix/index.htm) 

	ClickFix is a plug-in for Cool Edit 2000 and Cool Edit Pro that removes unwanted clicks and pops from audio signals.  ClickFix and Cool Edit make an ideal combination for cleaning up LPs before transferring them to CD.

-	![dbPowerAmp Icon](/techHQ/progIcons/media/converters/755__dBpowerAMP.gif)  [DBpowerAMP](http://www.dbpoweramp.com/) 

	NO LONGER FREEWARE FOR NEWEST VERSIONS
	         
	 This is a context menu (right click in explorer) audio converter.&nbsp; DBpowerAMP can also be used as a ripper so you can turn your CDs into mp3s.
	         
	 Now it seems they even want you to pay for the LAME mp3 codec, which is free in almost every other program, that I can think of. I love the context menu of this program and do plan to downgrade to the latest freeware version to see if it still works on Windows 7, for me. I am not sure if i want to NOT recommend this program or still advice people to give it a try. I (as you can tell) have mixed feelings about this one now that it went from Freeware to Shareware
