		<div class="progDesc">
			<p>Adjusts volume on mp3s so there is not one really loud one and one you have to turn the volume up to hear.</p>
security
			<p><em>COMMENT:</em> I am not saying this program is not that good... but I personally like &quot;Mp3Trim (pro)&quot; better.
			mp3s I adjust with Mp3 Gain seems to be a tad off (volume and overall sound) afterwards</p>

			<a href="http://www.littlelan.com/mp3nity">Mp3nity</a>
		</div>

		<div class="progDesc">
			<p>Not the prettiest, but a very decent ID3 editor that can lookup tags, Cover Images, and Lyrics ... I have had alot of
			programs (like Winamp) return very odd results, UNRELATED to what the mp3 actually is ..</p>
			<p>Mp3nity while it could use some interface work .. .it does really well. I am impressed</p>

			<p>You want a good, FREE Mp3 Encoder, Ripper, and Decoder? This is your program. I will say that it is not as fast as

		</div>

	   <div class="progDesc">
		   <p>NO LONGER FREEWARE FOR NEWEST VERSIONS</p>

			<p>This is a context menu (right click in explorer) audio converter. DBpowerAMP can also be used as a ripper so you can
			turn your CDs into mp3s.</p>

			<p>Now it seems they even want you to pay for the LAME mp3 codec, which is free in almost every other program, that I can
			think of. I love the context menu of this program and do plan to downgrade to the latest freeware version to see if it
			still works on Windows 7, for me. I am not sure if i want to NOT recommend this program or still advice people to give it a
			try. I (as you can tell) have mixed feelings about this one now that it went from Freeware to Shareware</p>
