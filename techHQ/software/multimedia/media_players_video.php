			One of my favorite video player ... only second to VLC in my opinion. I have found a few video
			files (not many, but I do work with MANY total video files) &quot;freeze&quot; or lag in VLC. I play them in GOM and there
			is 100% NO ISSUE what so ever with the playback. This is a good &quot;secondary&quot; player to have even if you use VLC
			for everything, video related.

			<p>Very similar to GOM Player</p>
			<p class="redtext">KMP is a program that plays multimedia files. Usually, we use Windows Media Player to watch movies or
			broadcasting, but Windows Media Player provides simple functions of a player so that the program falls short of expressing
			diverse information contained in videos.</p>
			
			<p class="redtext">On the contrary, KMP provides various functions to set diverse software and hardware and to recognize
			and set various display devices in order to use various formats of video information and their captions currently provided
			for users.</p>

			<p>(2010 note: I have noticed that despite what setting I put things on, that KMPlayer freezes (video and computer) that
			GOM Player and VLC have NO PROBLEMS WITH. I am planning on looking into this further)</p>

			<p class="redtext">SMPlayer intends to be a complete front-end for MPlayer, from basic features like playing videos, DVDs,
			and VCDs to more advanced features like support for MPlayer filters and more.</p>
			<p>*(from SMPlayer Readme File)</p>
			<p>This one I have not used alot, though I DO LOVE it. SMPlayer IS CROSS PLATFORM (Like Libre/Open Office, Chromium,
			Firefox, VLC.....etc) so if you like it and are also running Linux, you can run SMPlayer in either Operating System</p>

			<p>A Great Multi-platform video (and audio too) media player,that is my favorite and the one I use daily</p>
			<p>The codecs need for most media players (if not already on one&#39;s computer) ... is included with the program... even

	   <div class="progDesc">
        <p>This if from the makers of KMPlayer which seems like a good program (along the lines of a VLC or GOM Player) though it
        randomly freezes the video/DVD for no reason and locked up my faster computer when I tried it).</p>
        
		<p>So far, Pot Player is perfect. I can not say its better than VLC or GOM Player, though I can say it doesn&#39;t have the
        problems I have experienced with it&#39;s &quot;cousin&quot; (I just made that up), KMPlayer</p>
        
		<p>This is 100% worth a look for video file enthusiasts</p>

	<p style="clear:both;">What I use: Honestly other than PowerDVD and KMPlayer (though I&#39;d be willing to try an updated
    version to see if they fixed the bugs), I use ALL of the Video Players listed here, depending on what I feel like using at a
    particular time.</p>
