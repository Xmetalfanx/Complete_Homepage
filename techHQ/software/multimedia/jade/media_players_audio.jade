            | I just found this one and it doesn&apos;t have a ton of features, although it does contain a basic (3 band, if i
            | remember) equalizer ... the key for this one is that, the current version is 183kb ... (YES, I typed KB) ... which makes it VERY VERY SMALL ... also, like XMPlay, it IS portable
          p
            | It doesn&apos;t have addon support, however, for an media player under 200kb, you can&apos;t get too picky.
          p
            | The fact that it is so basic and &quot;ridiculously small&quot; may be a selling point for some people.

              | : Many sites have this listed as the &quot;Best replacement&quot; (looks alot
              |  alike, has many good features, great sound quality) for Winamp. I have been using this for a few 
              | days now, and I can see  why those sites I am refering to come to that conclusion.
      
            p
              | I am a HUGE Foobar fan and I am not saying I am switching to AIMP &quot;full time&quot;, though I have to say that if
              | you forced me to make a choice, considering all of these players. (for a Winamp replacement), Foobar (
              span.italics which I have been using regularly for a few years now
              | ) and AIMP would be tied for the #1 spot.
              |        Try them both and see which you like better.

              span.boldUnderline Tip
              | : A tip I&apos;d like to give people is about audio distortion. I gave up on AIMP
              |  awhile back where everything sounded a bit distorted. (Note: I use some DSP plugins for Winamp with AIMP too) is where it
              |  says &quot;Enhancer&quot; and &quot;Base&quot; ... DON&apos;T ADJUST IT TOO MUCH, or it will sound distorted. I found this out by adjusting these settings TOO much..
              |        
            |        
            p
              | Also I have noticed some distortion when (in the same Audio &quot;settings&quot; menu) &quot;Normalize by
              | Amplitude&quot; IS NOT CHECKED. Though please try different settings and see what sounds best for your setup.

                  | This player REALLY surprised me. I had used it and never thought twice to use it again... then a friend told me how great it was and after setting some of the professional version&apos;s reverb 
                  | and equalizer options.. J.A.P. sounds better then Winamp WITH the DFX or in some cases the Izotope Ozone Plugin too.

                  | Like 1by1 or Clementine, one of the downsides to Jet Audio is that (matter of opinion) there are
                  | better choices out there. This product, like those other two ARE NOT bad by any means. IF I even list the   
                  | program here on my site, then &quot;it&apos;s worth a try&quot;

          p
            | This is a lightweight (resource wise, not in features) audio media player that sometimes gets overlooked. It has support
            | for MANY of Winamp&apos;s addon/plugins, as well as a decent equalizer. This may not be Big and flashy, but it does what it
            | is suppose to do (Playing audio files) really well. I would ask anyone (even with Foobar and AIMP), to at least give this one a chance.

            | : This is one of my favorite audio player.
          p
            | This has one major feature, that puts it on &quot;top&quot; in my book, that others like foobar are lacking ...
            a(href='#addon') WINAMP PLUGIN support
            |  which makes audio sound much better. The TOTAL INSTALL DIRECTORY SIZE (minus
            |   &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;addons) is 1.5MB, which is much smaller compared to many others, ... even Winamp
          p This is portable too ... unzip and your ready to go.
          p
            | As much recent attention that AIMP and Foobar have been getting with the &quot;Winamp shutdown&quot;, XMplay is not to be forgotten. Some users may not like the interface,

            | Winamp has a decent plugin and skin collection which can add many features to a media player that has many features
            | built in already. There are better options out there, though Winamp is one of the old (I used it for over twelve years now and still have it installed) favorites/&quot;must have&quot;
            |  programs on the internet. It CAN play videos though I never
            | had luck with it (skipping any other problems occured), and I choose to go with one of the Videos Players I list below for videos. Audio file-wise .. Winamp is great.

            span.boldUnderline Comments
            | : AOL which bought Winamp a number of years ago, have recently (2013) decided to
            | close down Winamp for good. Though many alternatives are out there, I feel loyal in some way, to Winamp. It has been reported that even some of the Winamp developers have been frustrated with the lack of development/innovation since AOL took over.
          p
            | At the time I am typing this, I am not sure all the pages with Winamp items (plugins and skins) will be shut down, 
            | or even if another site setup by Winamp supports would get &quot;in trouble&quot; with AOL. I am hoping (though I  
            | do notexpect it to happen) AOL would release the code (after all it was freeware years ago, before there was even 
            | a Winamp Pro version) and have Winamp go to a site such as SouceForge and become Open Source.
          p
            | I have seen a few programs that the original developer no longer wants to develop a program and then releases the code to coders who want to &quot;take over&quot; the project. I wish Winamp would follow this path&lt;
          p
            | I DO HAVE TO SAY, that while for rare tracks, Winamp may have issues,.... most of the time Winamp&apos;s Gracenote ID3 look I have found to be one of the best, compared to almost any other media player application.
