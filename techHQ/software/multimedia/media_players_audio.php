		   <p>I just found this one and it doesn&#39;t have a ton of features, although it does contain a basic (3 band, if i
			remember) equalizer ... the key for this one is that, the current version is 183kb ... (YES, I typed KB) ... which makes it
			VERY VERY SMALL ... also, like XMPlay, it IS portable</p>
			<p>It doesn&#39;t have addon support, however, for an media player under 200kb, you can&#39;t get too picky.</p>
			<p>The fact that it is so basic and &quot;ridiculously small&quot; may be a selling point for some people.</p>

		<div class="progDesc">
		   <p>AIMP has a similar (though I have to say &quot;more updated&quot; look to Winamp, as well as a good playlist editor, and
			equalizer, and decent skins.</p>
			
			<p>
			<span class="boldUnderline">Comments</span>: Many sites have this listed as the &quot;Best replacement&quot; (looks alot
			alike, has many good features, great sound quality) for Winamp. I have been using this for a few days now, and I can see
			why those sites I am refering to come to that conclusion.</p>
			<p>I am a HUGE Foobar fan and I am not saying I am switching to AIMP &quot;full time&quot;, though I have to say that if
			you forced me to make a choice, considering all of these players. (for a Winamp replacement), Foobar (
			<span class="italics">which I have been using regularly for a few years now</span>) and AIMP would be tied for the #1 spot.
			Try them both and see which you like better.</p>
			
			<p>
			<span class="boldUnderline">Tip</span>: A tip I&#39;d like to give people is about audio distortion. I gave up on AIMP
			awhile back where everything sounded a bit distorted. (Note: I use some DSP plugins for Winamp with AIMP too) is where it
			says &quot;Enhancer&quot; and &quot;Base&quot; ... DON&#39;T ADJUST IT TOO MUCH, or it will sound distorted. I found this
			out by adjusting these settings TOO much..</p>
			<p>Also I have noticed some distortion when (in the same Audio &quot;settings&quot; menu) &quot;Normalize by
			Amplitude&quot; IS NOT CHECKED. Though please try different settings and see what sounds best for your setup.</p>

		</div>
       

		<div class="progDesc">
		   <p>Clementine is a cross platform (For Windows or Linux, at least) media player that has a feeling of a &quot;Cross between
			Linux&#39;s Amarok and one of my favorite programs, Window&#39;s Foobar (though it may not have all the advantages of
			Foobar) . Clementine has an equalizer, decent sound, and an apparent (I haven&#39;t tested it yet, though it looks good)
			ID3 Tag Lookup tool.</p>
			
			<p>
			<span class="boldUnderline">Comments</span>: I am still new to this one and I have to say that it looks promising. The one
			thing (MS Windows wise) that makes this &quot;down on my list&quot; is the fact that there are so many other good choices
			... it has nothing to do with Clementine not being a good product.

			<p>This player REALLY surprised me. I had used it and never thought twice to use it again... then a friend told me how
			great it was and after setting some of the professional version&#39;s reverb and equalizer options.. J.A.P. sounds better
			then Winamp WITH the DFX or in some cases the Izotope Ozone Plugin too.</p>

			<p class="mainSiteUpdates">Like 1by1 or Clementine, one of the downsides to Jet Audio is that (matter of opinion) there are
			better choices out there. This product, like those other two ARE NOT bad by any means. IF I even list the program here on
			my site, then &quot;it&#39;s worth a try&quot;</p>

		</p>
        
		<div class="progDesc">
			<p>Winamp has a decent plugin and skin collection which can add many features to a media player that has many features
			built in already. There are better options out there, though Winamp is one of the old (I used it for over twelve years now
			and still have it installed) favorites/&quot;must have&quot; programs on the internet. It CAN play videos though I never
			had luck with it (skipping any other problems occured), and I choose to go with one of the Videos Players I list below for
			Videos. Audio file-wise .. Winamp is great.</p>
			
			<p>
			<span class="boldUnderline">Comments</span>: AOL which bought Winamp a number of years ago, have recently (2013) decided to
			close down Winamp for good. Though many alternatives are out there, I feel loyal in some way, to Winamp. It has been
			reported that even some of the Winamp developers have been frustrated with the lack of development/innovation since AOL
			took over</p>
        
			<p>At the time I am typing this, I am not sure all the pages with Winamp items (plugins and skins) will be shut down, or
			even if another site setup by Winamp supports would get &quot;in trouble&quot; with AOL. I am hoping (though I do not
			expect it to happen) AOL would release the code (after all it was freeware years ago, before there was even a Winamp Pro
			version) and have Winamp go to a site such as SouceForge and become Open Source.</p>
			<p>I have seen a few programs that the original developer no longer wants to develop a program and then releases the code
			to coders who want to &quot;take over&quot; the project. I wish Winamp would follow this path&lt;</p>
			<p>I DO HAVE TO SAY, that while for rare tracks, Winamp may have issues,.... most of the time Winamp&#39;s Gracenote ID3
			look I have found to be one of the best, compared to almost any other media player application.</p>

			<a href="http://www.un4seen.com/" target="_blank">Xmplay</a>
		</p>
       
		<div class="progTableDesc">
		   <p>This is a lightweight (resource wise, not in features) audio media player that sometimes gets overlooked. It has support
			for MANY of Winamp&#39;s addon/plugins, as well as a decent equalizer. This may not be Big and flashy, but it does what it
			is suppose to do (Playing audio files) really well. I would ask anyone (even with Foobar and AIMP), to at least give this
			one a chance.</p>
			<p>
			<span class="boldUnderline">Comments</span>: This is one of my favorite audio player.</p>
			<p>This has one major feature, that puts it on &quot;top&quot; in my book, that others like foobar are lacking ... 
			<a href="#addon">WINAMP PLUGIN support</a> which makes audio sound much better. The TOTAL INSTALL DIRECTORY SIZE (minus
			addons) is 1.5MB, which is much smaller compared to many others, ... even Winamp</p>
			<p>This is portable too ... unzip and your ready to go.</p>
			<p>As much recent attention that AIMP and Foobar have been getting with the &quot;Winamp shutdown&quot;, XMplay is not to
			be forgotten. Some users may not like the interface,</p>
			<p style="clear:both;">
			<span class="underline">What I use</span>: 
			<span class="redtext">Foobar</span>, though I am starting to see why many of the sites listing &quot;Winamp
			alternatives&quot;, say the best replacement is 
			<span class="redtext">AIMP</span>, and 
			<span class="redtext">XmPlay</span> (all of them are great choices)</p>
