  |  I have recently tried a program I downloaded awhile back and alot of Linux users say they love, called 
  span.text-danger PartImage
  span.italics  (think of a better Norton Ghost)
  |  for more File systems..
p.text-justify
  | Some say it has issues with NTFS, others say despite the &quot;experimental&quot; label on NTFS ... It backs up NTFS and restores no problem.

  | I have backed up my Ext3 Ubuntu drive (have not had to reformat that yet to try &quot;restoring&quot; it yet. Working with Windows 7 and XP, Slackware 12, and Ubuntu (or Kbuntu actually ... Ubuntu with KDE interface instead of Gnome), I plan to try NTFS ... I am not planning on wiping out a good NTFS partition to see if the backed up images work. If for some reason you haven&apos;t heard of 
  span.text-danger PartImage
  |  that runs on Linux or Linux Boot CDs, you may think of the following comparisons

    span.text-danger PartImage
    |  is a better alternative to Norton Ghost

    span. GParted
    |  is like Partition Magic
    |         
    ul
      li.text-justify
        | unlike it&apos;s PM Windows-only counterpart GParted supports alot more file systems and from talking to alot of technicians who are better then I am

          img(src='../smiles/funny/tease.gif', width='57', height='55', alt='teasing smile')
          | ... I admit it )
        | , they all use GParted instead of Partition Magic too
p.text-justify
  | Remember if you get a bootable CD with either 
  span.text-danger PartImage or Gparted
  |  on them ... YOU DON&apos;T HAVE TO USE LINUX necessarily ... meaning you can adjust and change a bunch of NTFS partitions with a bootable copy of GParted, and install Windows only. ... Don&apos;t think &quot;I have to install full blown Linux to use either of these
p.text-justify
  | I hope to have a review of PartImage backing up Windows NTFS up soon, so you all can know if that&apos;s as good as I think it is.
