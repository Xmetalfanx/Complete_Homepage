  I have recently tried a  program I downloaded awhile back and alot of Linux users say they love,
  called <span class="redtext">PartImage</span><span class="italics"> (think of a better Norton Ghost)</span> for more File systems.. </p>
  <p class="justify">Some say it has issues with NTFS, others say despite the &quot;experimental&quot; label on NTFS ... It backs up NTFS and
  restores no problem. </p>
  <p class="justify">I have backed up my Ext3 Ubuntu drive (have not had to reformat that yet to try &quot;restoring&quot; it yet. Working with
  Windows 7 and XP, Slackware 12, and Ubuntu (or Kbuntu actually ... Ubuntu with KDE interface instead of Gnome), I plan to try NTFS ... I am not planning on wiping out a good NTFS partition to see if the backed up images work. If for some reason you haven't heard of <span class="redtext">PartImage</span> that runs on Linux or Linux Boot CDs, you may think of the following comparisons</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="redtext">PartImage</span> is a better alternative to Norton Ghost</li>
    <li><span class="redtext">GParted</span> is like Partition Magic
      <ul>
        <li class="justify">unlike it's PM Windows-only counterpart GParted supports alot more file systems and from talking to alot of technicians who are better then I am <span class="italics">(yeah, there are people smarter than me ... hardy har har<img src="../smiles/funny/tease.gif" width="57" height="55" alt="teasing smile" />... I admit it )</span>, they all use GParted instead of Partition Magic too </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="justify">Remember if you get a bootable CD with either <span class="redtext">PartImage</span> or
  <span class="redtext">GParted</span> on them ... YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE LINUX necessarily ...
    meaning you can adjust and change a bunch of NTFS partitions with a bootable copy of GParted, and install Windows only. ... Don't think &quot;I have to install full blown Linux to use either of these </p>
  <p class="justify">I hope to have a review of PartImage backing up Windows NTFS up soon, so you all can know if that's as good as I think it is. </p>
