  <p>These are Windows based programs, and I am not including many of the programs many distro's of Linux installs by default (for now anyway)... I may include that in the Linux Section instead of this mostly Windows Software Section, if I do add a list of Linux Apps.
  </p>    
  <p>The Descriptions may be very brief and not show &quot;EVERYTHING&quot; these programs can really do.   I do NOT suggest using these programs for cheating as sometimes they can show you the correct answer, but rather use them as a tool (perhaps on problems your stuck on) to see HOW TO GET to that answer.

  <p>I was not great at math in school, and even some &quot;pushes&quot; in the right direction on how to solve a particular problem, would have really helped. If you are really struggling, tell your instructor or research ways to get help. I know I wish I did. 
  </p>    
  <p>I study varies math just as a hobby (to learn more) and do not claim to be an expert in any of the subjects I mention below.
