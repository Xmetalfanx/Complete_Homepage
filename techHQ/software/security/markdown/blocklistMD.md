You can think of The Blocklist Manager is sort or a Firewall  Auto-updater. It doesn&#39;t actually update your firewall, but IP addresses to block. I am not a networking guy, and the explanation would be too long to post on the site, so in general an IP address is  like a home address. Each computer on the Internet is assigned an IP address. The RIAA, MPAA, and others (the people monitoring Kazaa for Example) all have a set IP that may be changing. Certain IP&#39;s may   be known hackers, or sending out mass pings (For a DDoS Attacks)... They also have set IP addresses that several web sources keep track     of.

       
You can use This program to autodownload these lists, and export them  TO A mass amount of sources. The list is always being updated, but some of the exports are to

      
- **File Sharing Applications**
	- Shareaza
	- Emule (Emule and Emule Plus)
              
   
- **IP Blocker**
	- Protowall (Driver based TCP/IP Monitor that is said to be  able to block packets BEFORE they even get to the software  firewalls)
             
	- Peer Guardian (of course, eh?)
           
          
- **Firewalls**
	- Zone Alarm
	- Sygate
	- Outpost Personal Firewall
	- ... and many more.

#### Why use this program?... I have Peer Guardian

Very Very Good Question.. .Peer Guardian does a good job download a  central list.. . but there are other sources, and I have found the list that BLM produces when a few of the sources are checked (including the default list Downloaded by PG) is MUCH MUCH larger. But wait... DON'T remove PG, thinking its no good anymore... keep it and use BLM to export the list directly to PG <img src= "../../smiles/shock/wow.gif" alt="" width="18" height="20" border="0" />

<p class="mainSiteUpdates"> I would close down PG before hand... not sure if the new list will be initialized if it is open when you export from BLM  </p>
      

As I said its always being updated and bugs are always been worked out. There is no &quot;homepage&quot; to my knowledge. You have to keep checking the forum, where the developer is (will have link, VERY soon). He is always taking feedback and if there is a major problem, post it and it will most likely be worked out. I know a friend that dumped a project cause of constant &quot;THIS DOESN&#39;T WORK, MAN !&quot; and no help on how to fix these problems...... PLEASE be nice folks. I don't want to see this happening again. Most are OK; however, there are some people that are really mean to developers... and  remember folks, these programs are FREE.
