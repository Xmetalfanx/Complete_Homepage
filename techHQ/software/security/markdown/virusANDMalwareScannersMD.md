  <p>When I say antivirus &quot;rating&quot; I am looking at the overall picture... I am not just looking at the interface (although I do consider it), I do not look at JUST the prottection, AND DEPSITE WHAT SOME &quot;LAB TESTS&quot; will show ... I take real world experience into account. Whats the point of an antivirus that has so-so protection, COST MONEY, has a &quot;pretty&quot; interface, and slows your computer down worse then 1/2 the ivruses it &quot;protects&quot; you against?.
