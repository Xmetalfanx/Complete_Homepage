## My Personal Choices for the Top Cleanup Related (System/Cache/Cookies/...etc)

- ![bleachbit icon](/techHQ/progIcons/security/cleaners/bleachbit_1.jpg) [Bleachbit ](http://bleachbit.sourceforge.net/)

This is a great program and my &quot;#2 choice&quot; (first being CCleaner) for a temp File/System Cleaner
      
Like CCleaner this also supports &quot;winapp2.ini&quot; (The constantly updating &quot;CCEnhancer&quot; file that is sort of like an updating 
&quot;Database&quot; of folders/files/ MRU registry entries&quot; to clean.
  
  - ![CCEhancer Icon](/techHQ/progIcons/security/cleaners/CCEnhancer_32512.png) [ CCEnhancer](http://majorgeeks.com/CCEnhancer_d6547.html)
  
This little app is for CCleaner and adding many more programs to it's &quot;Database&quot; ... It doesn't remove anything (CCleaner) unless you  TELL IT to.
  ... you run this from time to time updating like a malware or antivirus scanner 
   
This is not &quot;needed&quot; for CCleaner to be effective, though I consider it a GREAT addition for CCleaner users.

This program is a little tool I have always seen, but I was never sure if it worked... Turns out it does, and works great tool. Might be one of my Must have  
programs very soon. 
    
This will clean your Browser Cache, temp files, cookies (Opera, Mozilla (suite), Firefox, and IE), among MANY MRU settings for common programs.  
   
 - ![Cleaner Icon](/techHQ/progIcons/security/cleaners/cleaner.png) [ Clean Up](http://cleanup.stevengould.org/)
 
This will clear tracks from your history, Temp Internet Files, and Cookies   folder .. I that there are alot of temp  cleaners out there, but this is
 one of my favorites (other then CCleaner) 

- ![](/techHQ/progIcons/security/PrivaZer_MAINICON.jpg) [ Privazer](http://www.privazer.com/)
    
Privazer had issues before, and after reading user comments, they HAVE fixed the program and I just hope I do it justice here listing the features.   The issue 
I do have with it, is though I know how to use it, the Interface COULD use some work.  I am just commenting on this since I could see some 
&quot;new&quot; users getting fustrated with the way it is setup and to be honest, even I am getting use to all the different aspects of the interface.         
     
*Features:  *
        
- Temp/MRU Cleaning        
- Cleaning traces from:            
          
   	-  The MFT             
   	- Free Space                  
     - NTFS's USN Journal     

 - * (I will use Dir Snoop (listed below) to confirm if this actually works like it says it does... even if it doesnt work, it could be a bug and would be fixed 
in future releases) * 
               
- Note: I am NOT saying this doesn't work.. I am just saying some &quot;Snake oil&quot; programs have claimed this before and then the 
            program doesn't actually clean anything.... I just want viewers of my site to know that before I make a claim (if within my reach of knowledges), 
             I try to make sure what I say is 100% true, before I say it.           
             
          - Downloaders                  
          - Flash/HTML5 Cookies        
          - All Browsers       
          - and much much more              
   
        - Apparently this works for Mp3 Players, Ipods, Flash (USB) drives and more 
      
IF your a user who gets confused easy  * (I am not trying to be insulting, I appologize for anyone who is offended by this)*
than you may want to skip this program. If you are not a &quot;tech person&quot; but you want to give this program a chance, then go ahead. 
 It really is good, it just takes some getting use to for some users.

 - ![Wise Disk Cleaner Icon](/techHQ/progIcons/security/cleaners/WiseDiskCleaner_MAINICON.jpg) [ Wise Disk Cleaner](http://www.wisecleaner.com/)
 
The database of &quot;cleaned areas&quot; is IN NO WAY CLOSE to CCleaners (even without any CCEnhancer file of added locations).. 
This program is by no means &quot;useless&quot; though., having a really decent Interface, &quot;Slimming System&quot;, and 
to be honest (just my opinion) one of the fastest temp file scanner (to scan all your files for say &quot;.tmp&quot; files and other related files 
no longer needed) I have tried recently.
       
<span class="blue">&quot;Slimming System&quot;</span> looks at a number of features/options in Windows and gives you the option to remove
 them to gain more space/remove unwanted items in your computer. Some of these items are:
     
- Saved Installers             
      - I am not sure if these are &quot;really needed&quot;, though this program says they are not ... 
                     
     - You may want to back them up [copy them to another directory) then remove them in the offical location via Wise Disk Cleaner... 
     If you have no ill effects on your system after a period of time., then (if you desire) you can remove that folder of backups you made.

      
- &quot;Sample&quot; Videos/Pictures/Sound Files that install in locations such as 
<span class="redtext">C:\Documents and Settings\~username here~\My Pictures </span> ...             
                
        - If you want to keep some of the samples, you may want to do the same as with Saved Installers and copy them to another directory also ... though I do
         beleive that you can easily restore anything you remove with this program ...but to be honest I am still messing around with it
         
- Un-needed Language &quot;packs&quot;                 
        - Say if you do have these installed and you are using Windows in English ... you do not need the &quot;japanease language pack&quot;
            
This combo of Temp file/folder cleaner speed and &quot;Slimming System&quot; is reason enough for me to recommend it. I do not think its a 
great replacement for CCleaner or Bleachbit, though its only about a 2MB installer, so unlike some other options, it will not &quot;bog down&quot; 
your system, if you have both (CCleaner + WISE, or Bleachbiit + Wise ... or even like me and having all 3 is no big deal)
 
### Additional Choices for the Top Cleanup Related (System/Cache/Cookies/...etc) 
  
- ![](/techHQ/progIcons/security/DS_NTFS_MAINICON.png) [ ](http://www.briggsoft.com/)
   
This tool will let you see  your directories and drives in hexadecimal and raw directory  form; You can unerase or permanently delete files that   
have been supposedly &quot;deleted&quot; already.    

NTFS and FAT32 are both supported    

You HAVE TO HAVE 5.10 or above to be able to use this with Windows 7, by the way    
  
- ![FCleaner Icon](/techHQ/progIcons/security/cleaners/FCleaner.png) [ FCleaner]()
     
A recent find, ...  and it seems decent though some fans of it say its better then CCleaner I disagree so far. I am NOT saying its not any good, but rather  I prefer 
CCleaner better... just a personal opinion. FCleaner is still worth a look.
            
*UPDATE: The more I use this program, the more I think this needs work. I am not attacking the programmer or saying it has a bad interface, but  from my 
own experience like an article (will have URL for this later) &quot;FCleaner vs CCleaner&quot; ... I found FCleaner listing cookies it removed from Opera (though installed, I never use Opera) and it left almost ALL of my Firefox (my primary browser) items even though I told FCleaner 
to remove everything. I can COMFIRM (at the time I am typing this) that, the article the says the same thing is correct.       
  
FCleaner is not bad, but it's far from perfect.  Keep in mind that FCleaner is &quot;new&quot; and CCleaner though being updated all the time for say ..
 .new Firefox versions ... HAS BEEN AROUND for awhile .. so give FCLeaner time

  - [Slim Cleaner ]()

SlimCleaner is another program &quot;CCleaner-like&quot; I recently found on Ghack.net, that provides similar functioning to the prior mentioned
&quot;CCleaner&quot;.
       
One thing I did not like about this program is that although I think the installer was small, AFTER you install it, you HAVE to go online to get the  database 
(the part of the program that tells SlimCleaer &quot;what to clean&quot;). This should be a basic part of the installer and they should offer an online option
 to &quot;update the database of Cleaning locations&quot;
       
Functionality/GUI wise from what I remember, it didn't seem too bad at all, though It offered (my opinion) no real advantage over CCleaner.   Bleachbit, 
or (the new one I am playing with now) Wise Disk Cleaner
        
This seems to also remove un-necessary (to have removed) items, which I do NOT like [Example, all of my Pidgin account info, plugins and etc etc were 
removed completely with Slim Cleaner]. I am not saying &quot;STAY AWAY FROM THIS, THIS IS HORRIBLE&quot;, but ... more less  <span class="redtext">
&quot;Your better off with CCleaner + CCEnhancer OR Bleachbit + CCEnhancer&quot;   </span>
   
###Secure Deleting (File/Folder/Freespace )

**<a href="http://www.heidi.ie/eraser/" target="_blank">Eraser 6.x</a> *
   
Install comments: before I begin, I want to say that the developer may or may not aprove of what I am saying I have done here. Think of Eraser 5 and 
Eraser 6 as two different programs if you want to, while doing the following. Install 5.x to a diretory named &quot;Eraser 5&quot; and Eraser 6 
to &quot;Eraser6&quot; and you can run both ... I have been able to &quot;play with&quot; 6.x and still use &quot;error free&quot; fuctions of 5.x if 6.x doesn't 
suit my needs for        
---      
      
This is the newer version, that has some changes and less options it seems. It also has some changes for Vista/Windows 7 (though 5.x versions, 
work just great on Vista and Windows 7)

</p>      
        
Before I list my &quot;issues&quot;/comments about the 6.x version, I want to make it clear I am not &quot;attacking it&quot; .. just commenting ... I know 
the developer has worked hard on the new version, and though I AM rusty, programming-wise .. I know programming is no easy task for a program like this one
              
<p class="redtext">Phrase below: Erase Method = The number OF, AND contents (what is actually over-writting the data)  </p>        
 
 #####Comments
<p class="progName">Comparing Eraser 5.x to 6.x   </p>        

-  6.x I am not sure is still by the same developer as 5.x though it was &quot;taken over&quot; or something to that effect.
          
-  There seems to be alot less options in 6.x than 5.x, though new changes are being added based on comments on the forum to the developer             
      
-  PEOPLE ... if you are going to contact any developer, use constructive criticism, PLEASE ... do not just resort to saying &quot;the new version 
stinks, what the heck did you do?&quot;
         
- 6.x has no current way to know if your current wipe/erase is completed ... this has been brought up and may be in future releases.... even a small 
Bubble-notification box in the system tray or something small and un-intruceive, as I recommended to the developer 
     
- There is no current (note: I mean in the stable releases.... the beta I have running seems to be on it's way to adding this) way to right click and erase AND 
select a &quot;this erase only&quot;-type method of erasing (That means how many passes on a per-folder/file basis)... this was a &quot;normal&quot; feature 
in 5.x             
      -  On that note, in the beta, the way you select which method involves going through about two extra dialog boxes .. though I am one for adding more options 
      ... this is 100% unneeded to me... having the initial Menu (see below for an example), have a drop-down list (that is in the second dialog box mentioned) right
       on that menu.. that will save the user time and aggravation 
         
- The context menu (&quot;right click&quot; menu) of the recycle bin allows you to erase the Recycle Bin in 6.x, though like the point above, you can not select
 the method.             
       - * My suggestion for this * : simply go back to the way 5,x had it with the number of different erase methods, OR have a 6.x/5.x hybrid ... have a submenu structure similar to 6.x has now, and then the submenu contains the list of method's &quot;5.x style&quot; ... either way., it will still &quot;look clean&quot; (cutting down on clutter in menus) as the programmer desires, AND add the feature back as a long time 
       
- [ Eraser 5.x](http://www.heidi.ie/eraser/) 
  
This Program is a highly configurable and FREE file wiper. This can do  both simple for new users, and complicated wipes, that experts can customize  
to their liking. ..
