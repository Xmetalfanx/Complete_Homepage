In this section, I list &quot;how good&quot; a product is and that is based on a few of the following factors

- Reviews from MULTIPLE websites (security wise ,and other user/website admin's opinion)
           
   
- My own experience on a variety of different machines, from faster computer to slower computers
      
  
I AM NOT CLAIMING these are un-hackable as any &quot;real hacker&quot; could get by a Windows-based software firewall, without issue. I  like most of these products for the ability to control which programs are allowed to access the internet or not. These program may not &quot;protect you from malware being installed&quot;, though they can help you or a tech working on your computer, SPOT what may be a malware or virus infection
      
One more note... JUST BECAUSE AN ITEM IS TRYING TO CONNECT TO THE WEB, DOES NOT MEAN ITS MALICIOUS AT ALL. Many programs just have an &quot;auto check for updates&quot; feature automatically checked by default. If you uncheck that option (in whatever program you are concerned about), then it will not connect or try to connect. 
      
  
<p>I have seen a few people get worried over &quot;common/legit&quot; programs just trying to check for an update to themselves.

 -	[Online Armor Free](http://majorgeeks.com/Online_Armor_Free_d4872.html)   
       
    This is a firewall that has been around for awhile, and I never really gave it a chance, and am sorry that was the case.
 
 -	[PrivateWall](http://www.privacyware.com/personal_firewall.html)   

    This one I found when looking at some sites reviewing, Online Armor. This seems like a great product and I do not even notice it on my older laptop that was slowing down with Comodo 5.x. Do not get me wrong, it still gives me the same prompts as most of the other firewalls; however, RESOURCE WISE (how much it effects performance) it is MUCH BETTER. (FOR THE RECORD, when testing Online Armor Free .. I would describe it the same way)

      <p>This is a very well known and trusted Firewall.
      </p>          
      <p>This seems to rate high (security wise) and no addtions they have done so far have effected (ex- They add some new 'flashy&quot; feature and the security drops off as how well it protects ... I AM SAYING that doesn't seem to happen with Comodo)
      </p>          
      <p>I want to mention that though I install CIS (Comodo Internet Security), , I never 
        <span class="maroonText">(I have other prograns installed that do a better job)
        </span> install the Comodo Antivirus component. I have seen reviews and it does respectable, though nothing to brag about. I trust 
        <span class="redtext">Avast, Nod22, Avira 
        </span>(even with recent additions of toolbars), or Kaspersky more.
      </p>          
      <p>
        <span class="boldItalics">Update since the Version 6 release of Comodo: 
        </span>I have to say that since version 6 was released, I have been &quot;turned off&quot; by Comodo and it's developer's seeming to even make that most basic &quot;firewall maintance task&quot;, really complicated. The new interace (in my opinion) seems to &quot;try to make Comodo prettier&quot;, and it ends up making you click through endless menus that a single &quot;Open Interface, go to Firewall Tab, then &quot;Settings&quot; &quot; use to be able to do. By the time you get to the menu/settings you want, you &quot;Forget&quot; what you were going there for to change in the first place.
      </p>          
      <p>I am not telling people to dump Comodo, though if you use Comodo, stick with the newest 5.x for now (at least that is my suggestion anyway)

 -	![Outpost Freeware Icon](../../progIcons/security/firewalls/1286__OutpostFreeIcon.png) [Outpost Freeware](http://www.agnitum.com/products/outpost/)   
                
 	Rates high on many review sites [(security review sites that test firewalls), NOT just user reviews]; although not as high as Comodo rates. 
              
 	I use the pro version, but I still love the free version of Outpost
      
     
 
 -	![Peerblock Icon](../../progIcons/security/1326__peerblock1_icon.png) [Peerblock](http://www.peerblock.com/)   
  
               
    ** This is an IP blocker and NOT SUPPOSE TO BE USED AS A FIREWALL REPLACEMENT... BUT RATHER A FIREWALL COMPLEMENT ** 
               
	<p>This is a nice IP Blocker that can block access from/to certain IP address on your computer. You can Google I{P Blocklists that you can import into Peerblock; although, I have found sometimes there are too many IP's blocked and sites like www.google.com can be blocked ... It IS VERY EASY to remove those &quot;extra&quot; entries., so its not really a big deal
            

 -	[Zone Alarm](http://majorgeeks.com/ZoneAlarm_Free_d388.html)   
     
     This is a well known one that has been around for years, and to be honest, though not bad ... I never truely cared for this one. I remember using Sygate, Kerio, and Outpost years ago, after trying Zone Alarm first... I am not going to into details due to the fact that not counting the GUI, I am not 100% sure I remember why I didn't care for this one, but its not the first one I'd recommend people try 
        
       
  <p style="clear:both;">      
    <span class="boldUnderline">Bottom Line
    </span>: Some Choices have things others don't, and vise-versa ... I honestly can not make up my mind on 
   
	<span class="redtext">Comodo-Vs-Outpost(free or pro)-Vs-Online Armor Free - vs Privatewall.
    </span> I think if you choose ANY of the four, it would be a good pick. If you are a new/novice user, Privatewall may not be a great choice for you; though THERE IS NOTHING that says you can not try it, then remove it if you dont like it. 
  </p>      
 
 	An example I will bring up is, Privatewall... I see it &quot;failing&quot; 5 tests (how good these tests are, I can not say) ... then I see the next test period (say 6 months later), the NEWER Privatewall is rated and it passes 3 of the 5 tests, with Privatewall ecoknowledging the 2 remaining failed tests (forms of protecting you) and saying they are gladly working on those two for the NEXT &quot;newer&quot; version. 
  

	- This can be an issue if a product focuses on &quot;tests&quot; that may not be good, however (in my Privatewall example for instance), I do not think this is the case. It is just a form of protection that was not in a prior version of Privatewall, being added in the new version.
    
	*(Note: I am just using this one product, Privatewall, for an example here), <img src="../../smiles/happy/b_010.GIF" alt="thumbs up smile" width="38" height="20" class="imgleft" /> Thumbs up, to Privatewall for this.*
