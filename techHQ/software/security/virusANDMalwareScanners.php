    <p>When I say antivirus &quot;rating&quot; I am looking at the overall picture... I am not just looking at the interface
    (although I do consider it), I do not look at JUST the prottection, AND DEPSITE WHAT SOME &quot;LAB TESTS&quot; will show ... I
    take real world experience into account. Whats the point of an antivirus that has so-so protection, COST MONEY, has a
    &quot;pretty&quot; interface, and slows your computer down worse then 1/2 the ivruses it &quot;protects&quot; you against?.</p>

	<h2>Overall Antiviruses</h2>
    <p>Here I will just give my list (or general list) ... for more information read descriptions below. Anything listed together
    generally means I can decide which one is &quot;better&quot;</p>

	<h4>My Top Four Anti-virus Picks</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <div class="progTitles">
			<img src="../../progIcons/security/AVs/1589__Avast!FreeAntivirus5_icon.png" alt="Avast Icon" />
			<a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download">Avast</a>
        </div>

		<div class="progDesc">
			<p>The best choiice for most users. And considering it was always tied (in my opinion) for #1 Free AV with Avira AND Avira
			has started partnering with shady vendors.... Avast is the destinctive #1 now
			</p>
		</div>

      </li>

      <li>
        <div class="progTitles">
			<img src="../../progIcons/security/AVs/egui_20000.png" alt="Eset Icon" />
			<a href="http://www.eset.com">Eset NOD32</a>
        </div>

		<div class="progDesc">
			<p>This is the only non-free Antivirus, other than Kaspersky, that I would highly recommend. IT has ranked #1 or #2 on many
			security sites (with Kaspersky as the other) for almost 11+ years now
			</p>
		</div>


      </li>

      <li>
        <div class="progTitles">
			<img src="../../progIcons/security/AVs/1430__AntiVirPersonal9_icon.png" alt="Avira Icon" />
			<a href="http://www.avira.com/en/avira-free-antivirus">Avira</a>
        </div>

        Not #1 due to note below ... this was in the #1 spot for the longest time</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <div class="progTitles">
			<img src="../../progIcons/security/AVs/585__kaspersky.gif" alt="Kaspersky Icon" />
			<a href="http://www.kaspersky.com">Kaspersky</a>
		</div>

	   <div class="progDesc">
	   <p>My &quot;old favorite&quot; that i used for almost 8 years ...</p>
	   </div>

	  </li>
    </ul>

	<h5>Honorable Mentions:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <div class="progTitles">
        <img src="../../progIcons/security/AVs/branding_25.jpg" alt="GData Icon" />
        <a href="">GData</a>
        </div>

		<div class="progDesc">

        <p>GData seems to get really high marks and get them over and over again. Even I do not know much about this one though it
        should be considered.</p>
		</div>

	 </li>
    </ul>



    <h3 id="malwarespyware-tools">Malware/Spyware Tools</h3>

    <p>There are many options, though in one way or another  <span class="navyText">(I like the free options, though both programs I list have paid versions with added &quot;features&quot;
    ... mainly a background scanner), I really only care for these two are to be honest one will be good,; however, using both on
    the same machine</span> (at least in my opinion) will almost gurantee you to be malware free ... especially when paired with
    COMMON SENSE.</p>

   <ul>
      <li>
        <div class="progTitles">
        <img src="../../progIcons/security/malware/mbam_IDI_MAIN.png" alt="Malwarebytes Icon" />
        <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/">MalwareBytes</a>
        </div>
      </li>


      <li>
         <div class="progTitles">
        <img src="../../progIcons/security/malware/SUPERAntiSpyware_ICONAPPLICATION.png" alt="SuperAntispyware Icon" />
        <a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/">Super Anti-Spyware</a>
		</div>

		<p>I have seen this scanner not getting as high marks as it use to</p>

      </li>
    </ul>


	<h4>Extra Tools</h4>
    <p>For badly infected computers here are a few more options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
      <div class="progTitles">
        <img src="../../progIcons/security/malware/ComboFix_100.png" alt="ComboFix Icon" />
        <a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/combofix/how-to-use-combofix">ComboFix</a>
      </div>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>I have seen ComboFix, first-hand help computers that were badly infected;</p>
    <p>New users, should only use this if reformatting SEEMS like the only hope, after MalwareBytes &quot;fails&quot;.... and to be
    honest a new user may want to seek advice from someone who has used Combofix before.. just in case.</p>


    <ul>
      <li>
        <div class="progTitles">
        <img src="../../progIcons/security/malware/rkill_100.png" alt="Rkill Icon" />
        <a href="http://preview.tinyurl.com/2dnzgj">RKill</a>
        </div>

        <div class="progDesc">
          <ul>
            <li>
            <p>This one is a must have; This one I have seen ON EVERY &quot;how to remove fake AV&#39;s (fake) or Malware
            scanner&quot; tutorials</p>Basically the steps are:
            <ul>
              <li>Reboot into safe mode</li>
              <li>Run Rkill</li>
              <li>WITHOUT REBOOTING Run Malwarebytes and remove anything Malwarebytes detects</li>
              <li>&quot;Done&quot;</li>
              <li>
                <p>
                <img src="../../progIcons/security/808__hijackthis2.gif" alt="Hijack This" />
                <a href="http://www.trendmicro.com/go/hjt/quickstart/?hjtver=2.0.2">Hijackthis</a>
                <br />(BE CAREFUL WITH THIS ONE), .. if you dont know what your doing, you may want to leave this one alone. If you do know
                what your doing HiJackThis can be VERY useful spotting items that should not be there and therefore pinpointing
                infections.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
