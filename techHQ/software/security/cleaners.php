        <p>This is not &quot;needed&quot; for CCleaner to be effective, though I consider it a GREAT addition for CCleaner

			<p>Privazer had issues before, and after reading user comments, they HAVE fixed the program and I just hope I do it justice
			here listing the features. The issue I do have with it, is though I know how to use it, the Interface COULD use some work.
			I am just commenting on this since I could see some &quot;new&quot; users getting frustrated with the way it is setup and
			to be honest, even I am getting use to all the different aspects of the interface.</p>
			<p><em>Features:</em></p>

			  <li>Temp/MRU Cleaning</li>

			<p>The database of &quot;cleaned areas&quot; is IN NO WAY CLOSE to CCleaners (even without any CCEnhancer file of added

			System&quot;, and to be honest (just my opinion) one of the fastest temp file scanner (to scan all your files for say
			&quot;.tmp&quot; files and other related files no longer needed) I have tried recently.</p>

			<span class="blue">&quot;Slimming System&quot;</span> looks at a number of features/options in Windows and gives you the

        </div>

        <div class="progDesc">
        <p>A recent find, ... and it seems decent though some fans of it say its better then CCleaner I disagree so far. I am NOT
        saying its not any good, but rather I prefer CCleaner better... just a personal opinion. FCleaner is still worth a
        look.</p>

        <p>*UPDATE: The more I use this program, the more I think this needs work. I am not attacking the programmer or saying it
        has a bad interface, but from my own experience like an article (will have URL for this later) &quot;FCleaner vs
        CCleaner&quot; ... I found FCleaner listing cookies it removed from Opera (though installed, I never use Opera) and it left
        almost ALL of my Firefox (my primary browser) items even though I told FCleaner to remove everything. I can CONFIRM (at the
        time I am typing this) that, the article the says the same thing is correct.</p>

        <p>FCleaner is not bad, but it&#39;s far from perfect. Keep in mind that FCleaner is quot;new&quot; and CCleaner though
        being updated all the time for say .. .new Firefox versions ... HAS BEEN AROUND for awhile .. so give FCLeaner time

          <a href="https://www.slimwareutilities.com/slimcleaner.php">Slim Cleaner</a>
        </div>

        <div class="progDesc">
          <p>SlimCleaner is another program &quot;CCleaner-like&quot; I recently found on Ghack.net, that provides similar
          functioning to the prior mentioned &quot;CCleaner&quot;.</p>
          <p>One thing I did not like about this program is that although I think the installer was small, AFTER you install it, you
          HAVE to go online to get the database (the part of the program that tells SlimCleaer &quot;what to clean&quot;). This
          should be a basic part of the installer and they should offer an online option to &quot;update the database of Cleaning
          locations&quot;</p>
          <p>Functionality/GUI wise from what I remember, it didn&#39;t seem too bad at all, though It offered (my opinion) no real
          advantage over CCleaner. Bleachbit, or (the new one I am playing with now) Wise Disk Cleaner</p>
          <p>This seems to also remove un-necessary (to have removed) items, which I do NOT like [Example, all of my Pidgin account
          info, plugins and etc etc were removed completely with Slim Cleaner]. I am not saying &quot;STAY AWAY FROM THIS, THIS IS
          HORRIBLE&quot;, but ... more less
          <span class="redtext">&quot;Your better off with CCleaner + CCEnhancer OR Bleachbit + CCEnhancer&quot;</span></p>
