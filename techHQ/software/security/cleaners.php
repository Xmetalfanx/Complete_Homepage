        <p>This little app is for CCleaner and adding many more programs to it&#39;s &quot;Database&quot; ... It doesn&#39;t remove
        anything (CCleaner) unless you TELL IT to. ... you run this from time to time updating like a malware or anti-virus
        scanner</p>
        <p>This is not &quot;needed&quot; for CCleaner to be effective, though I consider it a GREAT addition for CCleaner
        users.</p>

        <div class="progDesc">
			<p>Privazer had issues before, and after reading user comments, they HAVE fixed the program and I just hope I do it justice
			here listing the features. The issue I do have with it, is though I know how to use it, the Interface COULD use some work.
			I am just commenting on this since I could see some &quot;new&quot; users getting frustrated with the way it is setup and
			to be honest, even I am getting use to all the different aspects of the interface.</p>
			<p><em>Features:</em></p>


			<ul>
			  <li>Temp/MRU Cleaning</li>
			  <li>
				Cleaning traces from:
				<ul>
				  <li>The MFT</li>
				  <li>Free Space</li>
				  <li>NTFS&#39;s USN Journal</li>
				</ul>
			  </li>
			  <li>
				<p>Apparently this works for Mp3 Players, Ipods, Flash (USB) drives and more</p>

			<p>The database of &quot;cleaned areas&quot; is IN NO WAY CLOSE to CCleaners (even without any CCEnhancer file of added
			locations).. This program is by no means &quot;useless&quot; though., having a really decent Interface, &quot;Slimming
			System&quot;, and to be honest (just my opinion) one of the fastest temp file scanner (to scan all your files for say
			&quot;.tmp&quot; files and other related files no longer needed) I have tried recently.</p>

			<p>
			<span class="blue">&quot;Slimming System&quot;</span> looks at a number of features/options in Windows and gives you the
			option to remove them to gain more space/remove unwanted items in your computer. Some of these items are:

          <p>This tool will let you see your directories and drives in hexadecimal and raw directory form; You can unerase or
          permanently delete files that have been supposedly &quot;deleted&quot; already.</p>
          <p>NTFS and FAT32 are both supported</p>
          <p>You HAVE TO HAVE 5.10 or above to be able to use this with Windows 7, by the way</p>

        <div class="progTitles">
          <a href="https://www.slimwareutilities.com/slimcleaner.php">Slim Cleaner</a>
        </div>

        <div class="progDesc">
          <p>SlimCleaner is another program &quot;CCleaner-like&quot; I recently found on Ghack.net, that provides similar
          functioning to the prior mentioned &quot;CCleaner&quot;.</p>
          <p>One thing I did not like about this program is that although I think the installer was small, AFTER you install it, you
          HAVE to go online to get the database (the part of the program that tells SlimCleaer &quot;what to clean&quot;). This
          should be a basic part of the installer and they should offer an online option to &quot;update the database of Cleaning
          locations&quot;</p>
          <p>Functionality/GUI wise from what I remember, it didn&#39;t seem too bad at all, though It offered (my opinion) no real
          advantage over CCleaner. Bleachbit, or (the new one I am playing with now) Wise Disk Cleaner</p>
          <p>This seems to also remove un-necessary (to have removed) items, which I do NOT like [Example, all of my Pidgin account
          info, plugins and etc etc were removed completely with Slim Cleaner]. I am not saying &quot;STAY AWAY FROM THIS, THIS IS
          HORRIBLE&quot;, but ... more less
          <span>&quot;Your better off with CCleaner + CCEnhancer OR Bleachbit + CCEnhancer&quot;</span></p>
