        <p>Good Multi-client (you may not get all the features of each network... but if you want one program to say IM (or
        &quot;PM&quot;) you friends on various networks ... then this program is for you.</p>
        <p>Also i am not sure if Trillian is for Linux too, but i know this IS, so that&#39;s another advantage</p>

    <p>I have been using this more and more as my YMessanger &quot;replacement&quot; and I am getting more and more use to it and I
    like it</p>
    <p>You can also add msn/yahoo/and more smile packs (I hope to have urls to them) soon to make Pidgin feel more natural for
    those who are use to Yahoo Messanger</p>

        <p>My older computer is 768MB of Ram and Windows XP Sp3 and it runs the new &quot;GUI&quot; of Trillian with no lag and no
        issues... just for those that may have a slower computer and think &quot;I will not even try this, since it will most
        likely lag my system&quot;</p>

        <p>This is a new comer that has potential if you ask me, but still lacks in comparison to Pidgin, but as I said its a new
        comer, so new features and improvements are added all the time.</p>

    <h3>IRC Networks</h3>

          <a href="http://www.mirc.com">MIRC</a>
        </p>
        <p>Shareware IRC Client - It can be over-welming (as IRC can be) for new users... for them I suggest Pidgin. It doesn&#39;t
        have alot of features (Pidgin that is), though it will get you into rooms and give those users what they need.</p>
        <p>I hear you can sitll use the shareware after the time period (30 days I am guessing) but you will be greated with a
        &quot;nag screen&quot; telling you to buy the full version</p>

    <h2>- No Longer Developed - Hexchat is a fork of X-Chat that is still maintained</h2>
    <pre>
		<code>Free MIRC alternative that I just started using and is is fairly good ... I am no &amp;quot;IRC expert&amp;quot; so I do not
		know if it has everything MIRC has, but I do know this can be (In fact I think it was made for Linux, then
		&amp;quot;ported&amp;quot; to Windows) run in Linux too

        <span class="underline">Comment:</span> his is the one I now user and is apparently a
        &quot;spin-off&quot;/&quot;Update&quot; of XChat. The two look identical if you ask me, but since HexChat is being updated,
        I&#39;d go with this one. It starts to balance &quot;IRC features&quot; Pidgin doesn&#39;t offer, without being too over
        complicated for some users, like MIRC may be.</p>
