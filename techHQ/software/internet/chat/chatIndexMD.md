	Good Multi-client (you may not get all the features of each network... but if you want one program to say IM (or &quot;PM&quot;) you friends on various networks ... then this program is for you.

	Also i am not sure if Trillian is for Linux too, but i know this IS, so that's another advantage

	- Jabber
	- Yahoo
	- Also Networks like (with plugins)
		- Facebook
		- Twitter 

I have been using this more and more as my YMessanger &quot;replacement&quot; and I am getting more and more use to it and I like it

You can also add msn/yahoo/and more smile packs (I hope to have urls to them) soon to make Pidgin feel more natural for those who are use to Yahoo Messanger

- Use Multiple IDs for each network
- Plugins for additional networks

	My older computer is 768MB of Ram and Windows XP Sp3 and it runs the new &quot;GUI&quot; of Trillian with no lag and no issues... just for those that may have a slower computer and think &quot;I will not even try this, since it will most likely lag my system&quot;

	This is a new comer that has potential if you ask me, but still lacks in comparison to Pidgin, but as I said its a new comer, so new features and improvements are added all the time.

###IRC Networks

	Shareware IRC Client - It can be over-welming (as IRC can be) for new users... for them I suggest Pidgin. It doesn't have alot of features (Pidgin that is), though it will get you into rooms and give those users what they need.

	I hear you can sitll use the shareware after the time period (30 days I am guessing) but you will be greated with a &quot;nag screen&quot; telling you to buy the full version

-	No Longer Developed - Hexchat is a fork of X-Chat that is still maintained
-
	Free MIRC alternative that I just started using and is is fairly good ... I am no &quot;IRC expert&quot; so I do not know if it has everything MIRC has, but I do know this can be (In fact I think it was made for Linux, then &quot;ported&quot; to Windows) run in Linux too

	<span class="underline">Comment:</span> his is the one I now user and is apparently a &quot;spin-off&quot;/&quot;Update&quot; of XChat. The two look identical if you ask me, but since HexChat is being updated, I'd go with this one. It starts to balance &quot;IRC features&quot; Pidgin doesn't offer, without being too over complicated for some users, like MIRC may be.
