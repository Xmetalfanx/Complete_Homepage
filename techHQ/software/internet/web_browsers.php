&quot;My favorite sites no longer working with ~fill in browser name here~ !!!&quot;


<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="justify">Well, I can't comment on every page a user may have a problem with, Alot of webmasters make their site and view it in Internet Explorer and they think they are done... the issue I have is that some sites will not display correctly on Firefox, Konquerer (Linux), Opera, and/or other browsers. </p>
    <p class="justify">On My site, I DO KNOW that users of older browsers (Pre-Internet Explorer 5) may not see the content the way I intended for it to display, but for all (Windows based and some Linux based ... ) browsers. I personally view and navigate the site to make sure that (not counting a table being &quot;one pixel off&quot;) .. My site looks identical in all browsers. ...</p>
    <p class="justify"><span class="boldText">SUMMARY</span>: It may not always be the Web Browser's (programmer) fault for a site not displaying correctly.... I have even updated my site late at night, to find out ... I really goofed up a layout.. that is entirely (in the case of my site) MY FAULT ... not the user's or web browsers viewing my site.  IF A WEBMASTER FOLLOWS WEBSTANDARDS, this entire problem can be avoided </p>

<p class="header">Firefox &quot;Crashing&quot; Often</p>
<p>Well, I have used Firefox since about version .91, I think it was, and even counting the occastional alpha (releases BEFORE 'beta' ... beta being &quot;test&quot; .... alpha being a &quot;test of a test release&quot;) releases and I have never had issues with frequent crashes. Firefox has crashed from time to time over the year ... once a year maybe (with DAILY use), but nothing major. The biggest &quot;issue&quot; I run into are addons no longer working, though with <a href="firefox/forceFFAddons.php" target="_blank">my Force Addons</a> to work technique... that is an easy fix in 90% of cases</p>


<ul>
  <li>If you have major crashing with Firefox, my first thought is a corrupt profile. </li>
  <li>Two easy to use addons to manage/make addons are listed below to at least test of creating another profile will help fix your problem ... backing up your existing addons/themes/bookmarks/ and more with the addon, <a href="http://customsoftwareconsult.com/extensions" target="_blank">FEBE</a>, is a good idea at this step too. </li>
</ul>

<p><span style="width:15%;font-weight:bold"><a href='https://nic-nac-project.org/~kaosmos/index-en.html'>ProfileSwitcher</a></span></p>
<ul>
  <li>Nothing Fancy, ... just adds a way to easily get to the profile manager AND switch Firefox Profiles in the File Menu....
    Very Handy, if you ask me</li>

  <li>The other browsers, listed here, have nice additional features; however, Firefox/(any Firefox Clone), has the biggest list and the best addons, if you ask me (I do admit Chrome's addon list is growing fast)
    <ul>
      <li>There are tons of Themes, Addons (&quot;Plugins), that can completely customize Firefox </li>

  <p class="boldItalics">Note on staying with the 3.x branch of Firefox: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ok, I am not telling anyone they have to upgrade, though I have seen reviews that anything above 3.x is &quot;<span class="blue">horrible</span>&quot; and &quot;<span class="blue">why would Mozilla release 4.x or above?</span>&quot;....and just do not understand that. Sure I am NOT saying &quot;Everyone has to upgrade from 3.x, cause 3.x is so bad&quot; .. </li>
    <li>My Suggestions for those reluctant to upgrade:
      <ul>
        <li>Install <a href="http://customsoftwareconsult.com/extensions" target="_blank">FEBE</a> and backup

            <li>,,,etc </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Get a <a href="#profile">&quot;profile related&quot; addon</a> and created another profile file Firefox4+ (currently 13 is the latest). </li>
        <li>When you start Firefox 4+, can use this newly created profile, and add the addon, bookmarks, ...etc that you want.</li>
        <li>If yoiu get to the &quot;OK ... Firefox 4+ is not bad&quot;, but I still miss Firefox 3 at times.. YOu can always go to a site such as Softpedia or Majorgeeks, and download the newest 3.xxx PORTABLE version of Firefox. </li>
        <li>JUST REMEMBER WHICH PROFILE TO USE WITH WITH VERSION OR YOU MAY MAKE A MESS OF &quot;THIS ADDON IS NOT COMPATABLE WITH FIREOX 3.X (or 13.x ... whichever way)&quot; ... having two profiles (Even if mostly identiical) will keep this straight</li>

    <p class="justify"><span class="boldText">NOTE ABOUT THE ENTERPISE VERSION:</span> SOME SOFTWARE &quot;PRO&quot; OR &quot;ENTERPISE&quot; VERSIONS MEAN YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR IT. ... NOT THE CASE WITH AVANT. The big difference other than the 3 browser engines in the Enterpise version, is the fact the &quot;regular&quot; Avant versions are about 4 to 5MB to download ... Enterprise is about 40MB (at the time i am typing this)... BOTH ARE 100% SPYWARE/ADWARE FREE AND WELL ... JUST PLAN 100% FREE. </p>
    <p class="justify">If you want to stick with an IE based browser, but want more options, try Avant. It has Skins, 
      popup blockers (much better then the SP2  popup blocker in XP Service Pack 2, plugins, and much more</p>
    <p class="justify">I have only just found the 40MB version (40MB Download), that is obviously much bigger than the 4MB version found on software portals, though it contains a very new (Example the current Firefox version out is 19.02, and the version of Avant I have has the 19.0x engine) version of Chromium's Browser Engine and Firefox's engine (in addition to IE's which is the only engine you get with the 4MB version)</p>
    <p class="justify">This very of Avant is called Avant Enterprise Edition, and while I am against bloated software.... I have to say that Firefox is able 20 or so MB to download now ... Chrome is about 20 to 25MB last I checked, so a total of 40-ish MB for Avant with all 3 (Firefox, Chrome and IE) browser engines, is NOT bloated in anyway if you ask me. I will be playing with the engines and how they work in the coming days. </p>
    <p class="justify">Opinion: New versions seem to be less &quot;bloated&quot; to me then Maxthon's newer version, though that is just my opinion... Both are still better then just regular Internet Explorer to me. </p>
    <p class="justify">If you want my advice for an IE clone ... not counting SlimBrowser (there is nothing that says you cant install all 3 IE clones and try all three for yourself)... Avant would be the way to go... even if you opt for the 4MB version of Avant... thats much better than Maxthon. </p>

      <p class="justify">Opinion: I have to say with every release, I just keep thinking &quot;what is Maxthon thinking?&quot; ... I may be a Firefox fan and even Opera before IE clones, though I have to say Avant is not bad .... Maxthon just seems to go the way of some software developers I have seen, and adding more useless/ half working features and making the product bigger and &quot;clunkier&quot;. This time I MAY say that Internet Explorer itself IS BETTER than this (Maxthon) IE Clone in the newest releases.</p>
      <p class="justify">Avant and Maxthon in the earlier days (when both were almost identical and say Maxthon was in the 1.x versions) use to both be good choices. At some point they split and Avant (esp the Enterprise version with 3 browsing engines, in one ... see below for more on that) kept getting better (for an IE CLone that is) and Maxthon (just my opinion) got slower, clunkier and less useful. </p>

BOTH ARE NOT THAT BIG (@1-5MB AT MOST) ... try them both ... keep them both, if you like... make up your own mind.</p>
<p>Slim Browser I have uses for ... .personally I think it reminds me of Maxthon 1.x (even Maxthon and Avant seems to have gotten more and more &quot;bloated&quot; to me) ...
