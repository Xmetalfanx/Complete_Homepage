          <ul>
            <li>Addons to add features (but comes basic for those that do not want extra bloat)</li>
            <li>Themes to change the general style <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/"><img src="../../graphics/joke/firefox.gif" alt="Firefox Icon" width="81" height="49" border="0" /></a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>One thing I love is how basic it is without any add-ons You can add or remove different features at your own liking. Some features are useful but some are &quot;bloated and unneeded&quot; to some users ... WITH FIREFOX it's simple .. just don't add the add-ons with those &quot;un-needed&quot; features ... no big deal .. </p>

        </ul>
        <p>Shares (by Pale Moon's developer's own administioin) more of a code similarity to Firefox then 64bit Pale Moon does (I am not saying this is a good OR bad thing ... just putting that out there)</p>

        <td><p>I must say it does seem to be improving, though it seems &quot;incomplete&quot; to me. </p>
          <p>Before I go on, <span class="boldUnderline">Chromium</span> is the one I'd recommend and is the project that Google takes, adds a few minor adjustments and 
          slaps &quot;Google&quot; on it and calls it their own. Usually (feature wise/security wise). An example of the sort of concept I mean can generally be reflected 
          by the fact that when Cromium updates,  a few days later Chrome updates with the same patch.</p>
          
          <p>What I am saying is that <span class="boldUnderline">Chromium</span> is what Google Chrome is based on and doesn't have some &quot;features&quot; that 
          Google Chrome has (one of which I am thinking of is how Google has admitted (it's site) to Tracking users) .. </p>
          <p class="boldText">Advantages to Chrome: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Simple interface (this is also a CON, to me, but I cant deny some people love it. I will list the reasons I think this is a CON below), but if you like hardly any buttons, and a simple interface, </li>
            <li>Better than IE in load time </li>
            <li>Add-ons/Extentions (I can not recall what they are exactly called on Chromium-based Browsers)</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="boldText">Disadvantages</p>
          <ul>
            <li>(Note: what I said about about Google and Tracking users)
              <ul>
                <li> this would apply to Google Chrome AND NOT TO Chromium AT ALL </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Incomplete Feeling (The &quot;Simple&quot; Interface)</li>
            <ul>
              <li>There is a small progress bar in the bottom left of the Window when a website loads, when you hover the mouse over it, though it is hard to see and sometimes I have no clue if a website is frozen (stuck, and not loading, ... has a script error, ...etc) or if the connection is just slow</li>
              <li>Some things on the options (maybe &quot;preferences&quot; menus seem hidden or hard to get to, especially for &quot;new&quot; users. I could see where people would have a problem with it. </li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <p class="header">Scripts in Chromium-based browsers</p>
          <p>I have found (Thanks to <a href="http://www.ghack.net" target="_blank">Ghack.net</a>), 
          <a href="http://code.google.com/p/scriptno/" target="_blank" class="boldUnderline">ScriptNo</a>, that while different and not the same programmer as 
          NoScript (a &quot;famous&quot; add-on for Firefox). I have used ScriptNo and think its a great addon to any Chrome-based browser</p>
          <p class="header">Chrome More secure than Firefox?</p>
          <p>Some say that Chrome is ALOT more secure than Firefox , but that is <span class="boldText">NOT TRUE</span>. Both Browsers have plenty of bugs; however, one thing 
          I think that fans of both browsers can agree, ... both have less than Internet Explorer
