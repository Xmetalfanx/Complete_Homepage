      <p>For now I am not going into details about though these web browsers are clones (or &quot;Forks&quot;) of the popular Firefox Web Browser. In general, they are suppose to be optimized compared to  Mozilla's version. I have not seen any of them get to the level of &quot;Oh wow, its so much faster&quot;, though, even using fresh profiles, I have noticed version by version the offical Mozilla Firefox release getting slower and &quot;clunkier&quot; . While they are &quot;Optimized&quot; .. .some may say that these browsers act like Firefox should in &quot;the first place&quot;</p>
      <p class="header">Backing up your Browser Data</p>
      <p>To help miagrate your exisiting Firefox profile data, you can use a great Addon called <a href="http://customsoftwareconsult.com/extensions" target="_new">FEBE</a>, which can move Addons, Themes, Search Bar customizations, Bookmarks/Favorites, and more</p>
      <p class="header">Addons      </p>
      <p>I do have to mention that Pale Moon is the only one that uses &quot;it's own&quot; profile, WaterFox, and CyberFox (Which I admit, I just first tried Cyberfox a few hours ago), both use &quot;Firefox's Profiles, so I do suggest getting on of these two addons and (WITH FEBE TOO) create fresh profiles for the other browsers. I have never run into any issues, though you may want to keep them seperate in case something goes wrong.</p>

      <p class="header">&quot;My favorite Plugin (not addon) is missing&quot; </p>
      <p>** Note: Even I do not know the details of this, though I have to mention the problem of &quot;Plugin X is missing&quot; ... the issue is with a 64-bit browser and 32-bit plugins. If you install (or use a portable version) of a 32 bit version of the same browser (and have plugins in appropriate locations) .. you will see that missing plugin appear again. .. Hopefully this will give some users who have experienced this an &quot;ah HA ! moment&quot; of why this is happening.      </p>

            <li>This is the one I have been using most in place of Firefox </li>
            <li>I have seen frequent posts from the developer who seems like a really nice guy. He is NOT a fan of the upcoming changes that Mozilla is making to Firefox (and most users do not like them either)... these changes are &quot;code-named&quot; Australis
              <ul>
                <li>The default changes wouldn't be bad IF you COULD CHANGE IT BACK. The fact that the new Firefox releases will NOT be customizable (one of the reasons Firefox Fans like myself, love(d) Firefox for so many years) , doesn't make sense to alot of people. The Pale Moon developer says he will try to keep Pale Moon as Customizable (the way &quot;Firefox should be&quot;) </li>

      <p class="UpdateSummary">A Note about compilers and the two &quot;optimized&quot; 64-bit clones of Firefox</p>
      <p>** Just to note, the compiler used in Cyberfox and Waterfox are different. One obvious question one may have is &quot;which optimized version is better?&quot; or &quot;What is the difference?&quot;. For those that do not know, (in basic terms) a compiler is a &quot;tool&quot; that a programmer uses to transform their code into a program (in this case a Firefox Clone).</p>
      <p>Different compilers may construct (&quot;make&quot;) the program <span class="italics">(Firefox clone here, for example</span>) differently, though the end-user will probably not notice anything. While, I am thinking of it, I do have to say that even if there is an advantage to Firefox, with the exception of some of these Firefox clone programmers, are not a fan of Australis  (the big layout change that Mozilla is changing Firefox to, that makes customizing Firefox the way it always has been... .NOT POSSIBLE). </p>
      <p>Speed and Performance, you may notice a difference with the clones, though do not expect them to be &quot;1000 times faster&quot; or &quot;shockingly faster&quot; </p>

<p>My Comments: </p>
      <p>I admit I just got this downloaded and have not messed with it much though it looks decent and other than OfficeBlack (2.3) I have not run into ANY addon issues with it so far... I have heard it mentioned a few times on IRC Chat, so I figured I would give this a try. It looks decent so far.</p>

  <p>My Comments: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I have to say even with a fresh profile for Waterfox .. This may be the slowest of all of the releases, and I am INCLUDING the offical Firefox when I say this. I'd say &quot;give this a try&quot; though sticking with Firefox (even if only 32bit) may be a better option</p>
