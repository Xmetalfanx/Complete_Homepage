       <p class="header">I am worried  about being confused by &ldquo;new&rdquo; software I am not familiar with.</p>
      <p>First I want to say that other than an  unfamilar name for a program, the functioning of many programs (say  play, stop, &ldquo;next track&rdquo; ..etc in video or audio players) are no  different … its just the name of the program you'd use that changes</p>
      <p>Now, I have to say that many of the  (opinion here) best Windows program for a particular task, are cross  platform, so that means you can find &ldquo;familar faces&rdquo; in Linux  that you have used in Windows for years.</p>
