        <p class="header">&quot;What is a &quot;file manager&quot; and why do I care, Xmetal?&quot;</p>
        <p>Good question: A File Manager controls how you interact with the folders and files on your computer. I (just my opinion) find Microsoft's Windows Explorer (some know this as the &quot;My Computer&quot; program they see when pressing the &quot;My Computer&quot; icon). Here you can see the hierarchy of folders and files on your computer. Some people think that what comes with the Windows Operating System is the only choice. NOT TRUE.  </p>
        <p>All of these choice, have positives and negatives, and I advice you to look at each and after awhile, you can see which one works best for you. I think that the way (example) the way Windows Explorer is setup in a bit confusing for new users, in say Vista compared to XP. Some of these file managers I list, solve issues and make navigating your files much easier.        </p>
        <p class="header">Files Managers Software</p>
        <p>My top picks: </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://www.xyplorer.com/" target="_blank">XYplorer</a> and Free Commander (both have 100% free versions)
<ul>
          <li>I am not saying do not get the pro (paid) version of XYPlorer... I just think the Free version is jam packed with features as-is</li>
              <li>Both of these I have used regularly and they make my life alot easier than with the file/folder manager that comes with Windows</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Directory Opus 
            <ul>
              <li>(not free and to be honest, many of the freewares that lacked some Directory Opus &quot;features&quot; are gaining those features version by version (update)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

          <div class="progTableDesc"><span class="justify">This (though not free)r, is MY FAVORITE... The GUI (Graphic Interface) is just a tad nicer then other file managers, and like I said before, although it doesn't have any <img src="../smiles/shock/shocked10.gif" alt="Shocked Smile" width="25" height="30" />'wow' features&quot;, though, the way it packages common features of a 
          file manager together just looks (and more importantly... WORKS ) really well in this application </span></div>

I use to think Directory Opus was so much better, .. .now I can not say that any longer.</p>
