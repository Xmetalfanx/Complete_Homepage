        <p class="header">&quot;What is a &quot;file manager&quot; and why do I care, Xmetal?&quot;</p>
        <p>Good question: A File Manager controls how you interact with the folders and files on your computer. I (just my opinion) find Microsoft's Windows Explorer (some know this as the &quot;My Computer&quot; program they see when pressing the &quot;My Computer&quot; icon). Here you can see the hierarcEhancerhy of folders and files on your computer. Some people think that what comes with the Windows Operating System is the only choice. NOT TRUE.  </p>
        <p>All of these choice, have positives and negatives, and I advice you to look at each and after awhile, you can see which one works best for you. I think that the way (example) the way Windows Explorer is setup in a bit confusing for new users, in say Vista compared to XP. Some of these file managers I list, solve issues and make navigating your files much easier.        </p>


        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://www.xyplorer.com/" target="_blank">XYplorer</a> and Free Commander (both have 100% free versions)
          <ul>
          <li>I am not saying do not get the pro (paid) version of XYPlorer... I just think the Free version is jam packed with features as-is</li>
              <li>Both of these I have used regularly and they make my life alot easier than with the file/folder manager that comes with Windows</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Directory Opus
            <ul>
              <li>(not free and to be honest, many of the freewares that lacked some Directory Opus &quot;features&quot; are gaining those features version by version (update)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
