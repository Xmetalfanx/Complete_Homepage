	I am sure I have not seen a tutorial yet that DOESN'T include Malwarebytes.<br />

      <li><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/combofix/how-to-use-combofix" class="progName">ComboFix</a> -
        I have seen ComboFix, first-hand help computers that were badly infected; new users, should only use this if reformatting SEEMS like the only hope, after MalwareBytes &quot;failed'.<span class="underlineBold"> Note</span>: At that time I had no idea about RKill (listed below) so instead of running ComboFix, running RKill THEN Malwarebytes, may have worked as well</li>
      <li><a href="http://preview.tinyurl.com/2dnzgjf" target="_blank">RKill</a> - Listed on many tutorials as what to use before Malwarebytes on pesky infections that contain rootkits that try to disable Malwarebytes from cleaning your computer</li>

    <blockquote>
      <p> Both of these top two scanners have similar (Great) detection rates and are &quot;neck and neck&quot; as the best Free anti-virus if you ask me. Some sites say Avira is difficult to use, but I disagree.</p>

      <p><span class="italics">Avast Cons:</span> My laptop from 2002, has SLIGHT lag running Avast. (compared to Avira).. .new computers run Avast without any system resource lag of any kind (its up to a &quot;computer-by-Computer&quot; basis</p>

      <p>Those are Free, but if you feel the need to want to pay for one (for whatever reason), try (3) <a href="http://www.eset.com/" target="_blank">Eset NOD32</a> , which provides great protection and no system lag<br />
