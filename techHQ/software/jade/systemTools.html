      <p>These are more of a variety of &quot;System Tools&quot; freewares.  The list was getting too long, so I moved many of them to the System Tools &quot;Subpages&quot;, listed to the left.  If there is a well known freeware not listed on this page, odds are its in one of the subpages.</p>

          <p>This is the program (type) I have been looking for. It is a FREEware that allows you to have multiple virtual desktops that you can switch between. This program is HIGHLY customizable, and to be honest, I am still playing with all the options.</p>
          <p>There HAVE BEEN free programs like this in the past that didn&apos;t offer all the features, that I had been looking for. Also there have been programs (I can not recall the name) that had the functions and features, though were  priced at $29.99 or higher. This is a great little tool I plan to mess around with more in the coming days.</p>

          B) Go directly to the MS Knowledge base for a description (hey .. its an error being reported by MS anyway, eh?) have made this program catch my eye, the moment I tried it

              This is by far the best registry cleaner I have come across. I will post a full epinion (opinion) at epinion.com, as
              soon as they are done with the maintenance on their site. (I cant not post it until then). It will have details on this program there.

              This is an overall system Tools program with start menu cleaner, registry cleaner, registry compactor (I have run into

              Ccleaner&apos;s reg cleaner is not bad) ... alot of other reg cleaners have caused more problems then there worth. That is

          you may notice the second says its not &quot;perfect&quot;. You then defrag with the second defragmenter, and analyze the
          partition with the first defragmenter you used and find the FIRST now says its fragmented ... point is, I would stick with one defragmenter.
