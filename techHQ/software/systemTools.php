<p>These are more of a variety of &quot;System Tools&quot; freewares.  The list was getting too long, so I moved many of them to the System Tools &quot;Subpages&quot;, listed to the left.  If there is a well known freeware not listed on this page, odds are its in one of the subpages. </p>

		   <p >A Simple (one that actually works) Time Sync Program. I have tried many other options, but this is the only one that I found to really work ... grant it, that you\'ll (if your PC is not having trouble) only use it one time every say .. 8-12 months maybe, but still ... it works </p>

			   <p>This is the program (type) I have been looking for. It is a FREEware that allows you to have multiple virtual desktops that you can switch between. This program is HIGHLY customizable, and to be honest, I am still playing with all the options. </p>

				<p>There HAVE BEEN free programs like this in the past that didn't offer all the features, that I had been looking for. Also there have been programs (I can not recall the name) that had the functions and features, though were  priced at $29.99 or higher. This is a great little tool I plan to mess around with more in the coming days.

				<p>A simple program that has some filtering features for Administrators to view Window 2000 (and higher) \'s Event log.&nbsp; </p>
				<p>Not to say &quot;Oh my God, the viewer, built into Windows is SO HARD to use&quot;; however, little additions (like right clicking an error and being able to:</p>
				<p>A) search Google for that error/fix for that error or
				  B) Go directly to the MS Knowledge base for a description (hey .. its an error being reported by MS anyway, eh?) </span>have made this program catch my eye, the moment I tried it </p>

			<div class="description">
			<p>Allows you to manage the context (right click) menu better and to remove un-wanted entries that are sometimes hard to remove (even if you want to KEEP the actual program). </p>
			<p>I would look in the program (in &quot;question&quot; 's ) preferences or Options menu first .. but even with that ... I have found this program to be very useful.</p>
