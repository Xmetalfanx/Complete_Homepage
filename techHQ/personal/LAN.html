<p>A) I kept getting message about &quot;LAN Connection failed, You need an Internet connection setup&quot; (ok i 
  dont f00king remember exactly .. close enough :P) in PcLinuxOS INSTALLED on third PC I just got (uncle's old pc) </p>
<p>B) anyway... i loaded up vmware and tried the lAN &quot;out of the box&quot; (I didn;t set anything up) and it saw the LAN PC's and interacted 
  with them right away (THIS IS THE ONLY REASON I BRING &quot;VMWARE UP&quot; HERE) (btw, no &quot;no internet message here) </p>
<p>IN THE INSTALLED VERSION today I did the thing i should have done to start with ... i completely ignored that message and 
  pinged the LAN Pc's and they responded fine .. i went to konquer and tried to access the LAN PC's ... and it worked ..
  i just never tried browsing in the INSTALLED version since i saw that &quot;error&quot; message... yeah stupid i know</p>
