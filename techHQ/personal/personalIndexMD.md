##Welcome to my Homepage

I like many different types of music; although, I like Hard Rock and what some call "smooth" or "tropical" (with         Hawaiian instruments) jazz, the most.

I am often on sites like Yahoo Answers, helping  anyone I can, to the best of my ability ... At the time I am writing  this, I have over 9000 points (I really do not care about "points" but it does mean the higher the number of points, the more people I   helped)... This really makes me feel good when I get messages and  emails thanking me for what I told that individual.

 I am now re-kindling my love for studying Sciences  [including Astrology, Astronomy, and studying Physics which I had  "trouble" with) before] and Maths (in large part to Mr. Jason Gibson           and MathTutorDVD.com] such as Trigonometry and Calculus 1 and even         "Calculus 3", as well as sciences such as Physics and courses  pertaining to Electricity and Circuitry

####Studies

I graduated Stafford Senior High School. I have taken courses in Unix, Visual Basic, C, and C++, and am continuing my studies in (partly) programming,networking, and electronics (circuits, .wiring, ..etc etc)

Point being ... I never want to stop learning ... even if its just a hobby, there is always something new and interesting to learn

Besides "IT" and Electronics .. some of my favorite subjects to learn/subjects I am in some way studying are:

 -  ** History**
(basically this is my second favorite subject)...  I am always a fan of learning about the past and "what really  happened", and not just what one textbook said or what "one side  of the arguement/confict's point of view is"

	I like to possibly get all sides of an   "argument"/"situation" and see where both sides are coming from.

-    ** Maths **
   -  (refreshing myself on) Algebra 1 and 2
   -   Geometry
   -   Trigonometry
       - (mainly what I know of this so far is thanks to
          -[Mr. Jason Gibson and his tutorials](http://www.mathtutordvd.com) Calculus


- **Sciences**

  -	Physics as it related to electronics and just ...   Physics in general

 - Astrology/Astronomy
    -  I am a fan of such professor's as (seen on PBS shows and H(istory Channel) 2's "The Universe") Mr. Alex Filippenko.

 -  Anything related to pre-historic animals (not LIMITED to dinosaurs)

-  ** "Other" subjects **
    - Electronics and Electricity
    - Even back in highschool, I found "Accounting" interesting.

 For awhile, it felt like no matter how much I studied certain subjects, I just wouldn't get it. I figure now ..    WHY THE HECK NOT!?

	If I don't understand a topic I want to learn I just keep studying  until I do.
