    | I like many different types of music; although, I  like Hard Rock and what some call &quot;smooth&quot; or &quot;tropical&quot; (with         Hawaiian instruments) jazz, the most.
    | I am often on sites like Yahoo Answers, helping  anyone I can, to the best of my ability ... At the time I am writing  this, I have over 9000 points (I really do not care about &quot;points&quot; but           it does mean the higher the number of points, the more people I   helped)... This really makes me feel good when I get messages and  emails thanking me for what I told that individual.
    | I am now re-kindling my love for studying Sciences  [including Astrology, Astronomy, and studying Physics which I had  &quot;trouble&quot; with) before] and Maths (in large part to Mr. Jason Gibson           and MathTutorDVD.com] such as Trigonometry and Calculus 1 and even         &quot;Calculus 3&quot;, as well as sciences such as Physics and courses  pertaining to Electricity and Circuitry

		I graduated Stafford Senior High School. I have taken courses in Unix, Visual Basic, C, and C++, and am continuing my studies in (partly) programming,networking, and electronics (circuits,         .wiring, ..etc etc)


		Point being ... I never want to stop learning ... even if its just a hobby, there is always something new and interesting to learn

		Besides "IT" and Electronics .. some of my favorite         subjects to learn/subjects I am in some way sudying are:

			-  ** History**
		(basically this is my second favorite subject)...  I am always a fan of learning about the past and "what really  happened", and not just what one textbook said or what "one side  of the arguement/confict's point of view is"

			I like to possibly get all sides of an   "arguement"/"stuation" and see where both sides are coming from.

		-    ** Maths **
			-  (refreshing myself on) Algebra 1 and 2
			-   Geometry
			-   Trigonometry
				- (mainly what I know of this so far is thanks to
					<a  href="http://www.mathtutordvd.com" target="_blank">Mr. Jason Gibson and his tutorials</a>) Calculus


		- **Sciences**

			-	Physics as it related to electronics and just ...   Physics in general

			- Astrology/Astronomy
				-  I am a fan of such professor's as (seen on PBS shows and H(istory Channel) 2's "The Universe") Mr. Alex Filippenko.

			-  Anything related to pre-historic animals (not LIMITED to dinosaurs)

		-  ** "Other" subjects **
			- Electronics and Electricity
			- Even back in highschool, I found "Accounting" interesting.

			For awhile, it felt like no matter how much I studied certain subjects, I just wouldn't get it. I figure now ..    WHY THE HECK NOT!?

				![Hey Smile](../smiles/mad/angry8.gif)

			If I don't understand a topic I want to learn I just keep studying  until I do.
