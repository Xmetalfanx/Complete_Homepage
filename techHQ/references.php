<title>Xmetalfanx's Book References - What books did I use to get some information on my site?</title>

$the_content = <<EOD


    <p>Despite the fact that I do not copy from any book or website (if i do, I try to clearly mark that segment of my site is a quote and where it came from; i do want to link to books and references that have helped me with recent information. Some of these sources you can find on my links page, or at the bottom of that particular page with a (Information on this page came from <span class="italics">location here.</span></p>

    <p>With this page, I want to give thanks to books I have found useful and hopefully, the readers of my site, will go out and see if they can find the books I mention and find all sorts of useful information in them, that I have not been able to post. I hope to find a few links for each books (ex. Amazon.com) for where you can go to purchase these books online.</p>
   
   <p>I DO NOT CLAIM to be an expert on any of these subjects (nor any others) ... 
    Some &quot;experts&quot; in these things may disagree with &quot;oh that's a really
    good resource&quot;, but I am at the point of I am anything but a novice ..but 
    these references give me a good start with the respected subject. To give you a
    little background, several years back, I had a college class in C++ .. The
    professor apparently started studying C++ a few months after the &quot;main
    release&quot; of the programming language, years before. With college, they are
    told what books they HAVE TO USE to teach the subject and ... this professor 
    claimed that this book COMPLETELY CONFUSED him.

        <td>This may be one exception to the &quot;Plain english&quot; rule I list above. I also got this from the library and it's AMAZING if you ask me. This book claims how must network administrator's &quot;kind of... sorta&quot; poke around their security. This book is (INHO) getting a little on the hardcore side (which IS A GOOD thing). IT really shows you how exploits work and how to actually do them. I do admit that, THAT IDEA is dangerous if the &quot;wrong person&quot; were to get this and study it.  <span class="navyText">Network Security Assessment</span> has however spiked my interest in Network Security and how to secure (i mean &quot;really&quot; secure) your network. </td>
