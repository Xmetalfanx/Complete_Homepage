    This one has a a number of options,
    ...I still like doPDF alot but this is very nice and I see why they(though I do not agree with them 100 % , I find they have good suggestions and in many many cases(program category wise) I do agree with the order of the list...so when they mention a & quot;
        program & quot;
      like this one and say its better than the ones I know about and use, ...I think the programs are worth a look.
