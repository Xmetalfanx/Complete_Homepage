<p>(If you don&apos;t beleive me, go to the BleepingComputer&apos;s page that I link to below and you will see they generally all recommend the same programs/apps. Unless noted, all of these programs/tools are 100% free.</p>

      <div class="card-text"> - I have seen ComboFix, first-hand help computers that were badly infected; new users, should only use this if reformatting SEEMS like the only hope, after MalwareBytes &quot;failed&apos;. Note: At that time I had no idea about RKill (listed below) so instead of running Combofix, running RKill THEN Malwarebytes, may have worked as well</div>

  Anti-viruses
</h3><br/>
<p>Both of these top two scanners have similar (Great) detection rates and are &quot;neck and neck&quot; as the best Free anti-virus if you ask me. Some sites say Avira is difficult to use, but I disagree.</p>
<h4>Free AV Scanners</h4>

  <h5>Extra Comments <br/>
    <p>Those are Free, but if you feel the need to want to pay for one (for whatever reason), try (3) Eset NOD32 , which provides great protection and no system lag</p>

<h3>
   
  &quot;Wait! ... Some people claim that Free Antivirus dont remove the actual infections, and I have to buy an expensive scanner to actually remove anything&quot;
  <p>100% FALSE !!</p>
  <p>PLEASE do not let people talk you into &quot;you get what you pay for&quot; .. with the few exceptions, most of my favorite and security site &quot;best programs&quot; are free. Note though that with every release of every Anti-virus the detection rate can go up or down ... I'd never argue that FREE scannners are .. perfect so to speak ... but they at least use to be on par with any of the paid AVs </p>

  Things Pro (paid) versions of programs tend to have, the free programs do not:
    
  <ul>
    <li>Better tech support from company when you actualy purchase the software&apos;s Pro version         
      <div>
         
        This fact I even question, since at one point,  I had questions for Comodo AND Avast, and (via forum) both responded promptly, and answered my question(s) completely)
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>The detection rate of freewares (like Avast and Avira) are 100% the same.  THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE.</li>      
    <li>Paid Programs tend to bundle AV&apos;s + Parental Control Software + Firewalls + &quot;Spam blockers&quot; together .          
      <ul>
        <li>I find that using a different program for certain tasks tend to provde better security and allows me to choose what programs I use for what task.  Some All In One products tend to not be great at everything they do.<br/></li>
