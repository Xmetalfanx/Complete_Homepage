p
  | I will update this page often and do more research on whats best for security. I have had earlier versions of Comodo automatically set some of the &quot;Outgoing only&quot; entries I have listed below as &quot;Allow from ALL to ALL&quot;... which although that may be ok ... I like to have a tighter security settings.
p
  | Some people want less firewall prompts, but (as long as it remembers when i have &quot;remember setting&quot; checked) .. I dont care about prompts, as long it lets me know what is going on.

  | CLT.exe (Link coming soon) - Comodo Leak Test

p
  | Yes Yes, I know &quot;But won&apos;t CLT detect anyone runing Comodo&apos;s Program and give you a perfect score, in a sense .... CHEATING&quot;
p
  | I HAVE noticed that CLT DOES NOT &quot;BLINDLY&quot; give people running Comodo Firewall perfect scores
  p
    | My Results  - Sandbox is on, however, not used on both CLT.exe runs (see below for details ...

p
  | For those of oyu who dont know .... the higher the score, the BETTER .. a 340/340 result does NOT mean your vunerlable to all 340 expliots!

    li  Comodo x86 version 5.0 on Windows XP
      ul
      li
        | I did setup some rules without considering CLT.exe ... however, (i CANT REMEMBER HONESTLY how many settings I changed from defaults, but it was not too many if I remember correctly) ... I scored a
        span.redBold
          | 340/340
        |  result right out of the gate ... with CLT.exe NOT sandboxed, but any prompts (there were a few) by Defense+ for CLT.exe were &quot;Isolated&quot; (Denyed in other words)


    li
  | Comodo x64 (same exact version, but x64 version) on Windows 7 Home Prem. 64bit Ed.


    ul
  li
    | Right away after about 5 scans I received a (between)
    span.redBold
      | 190-210 out of 340
  |
  li
    | I am not exactly sure but I think I may have had Defense+ on &quot;Safe PC&quot; which each exe ran is learned (which added rule without me knowning)
  |
  li
    | I changed to &quot;Custom Policy&quot; in Defense+ and ended up getting a prompt for Sandboxing CLT.exe or not during the next run
    | ul
    | li
    | | If i choose to let it run un-sanboxed ... i still get @220/340 ...
    | |
    | li
    | | If I sandbox CLT.exe, I get a perfect 340/340 result


p
  | If you run thus on your computer, you may have browser windows popping up (thats a simulated exploit that its testing for) so dont be shocked .... its suppose to do that (if your not fully protected).

  | Default Settings for both Firewall and Defense+

  | It may not get a perfect score, but for those who dont want to mess with alot of settings and are &quot;new&quot; to computers or not conputer savy .. the default settings for &quot;safe&quot; but more probable &quot;Custom Policy&quot; (on Firewall and Defense+) tabs are PERFECTLY ALRIGHT in my opinion, for normal &quot;non-techy&quot; users
