            p Feb 7 2017 Update - I have been working on the templates and converting stuff over so i can then just go into the individual pages and apply the new way I am doing things all at once.

              | - Helps a user setup some things with a menu system on Ubuntu, Fedora, OpenSuse, and (minor things for this distro ... so far) Solus.   This includes adding well known third party repos, enabling coming setings not set by default, and adding common software in one shot

              |  This originally was going to be a part of the LinuxSetup scripts, though it grew too much and I decided to branch it out.

              | This installs themes and icon packs of well liked Linux Themes into your system.  I have alot of plans for this for version and distro detection.
