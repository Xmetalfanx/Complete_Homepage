<h2>Problems / Explaining my Database setup</h2>
<p>I will try to keep this simple but give as much info as possible.  Forget how things are connected to the site .... just focus on "a database"</p>


<h3>database setup - Related to Linux Distros </h3>
<ul>Parent table - "commonData" - has many common things related to the distro but basically what you guys need to know is there is a field "distroName" that is a shorthand name of the distro -   *** The distroName field is what I am trying to link the child tables TO with a foriegn key but I keep getting syntax errors when trying to do it anyway I see it in tutorials and documentation <em>Say ... "mint"... for display there is another field called "distroTitle" that would display "Linux Mint" for example ... but that is not the point .. </em>
  <li>childtable - screenshots -</li>
  <li>child table - a "recommendation/my comments table" -this has a variety of fields .. some "yes or no" questions ... others a paragraph style answer to a question of who/what/when i would recommend this distro</li>
  <li>child table - youtube reviews - pretty self explanitory ..</li>
  <li>child table - a usb creator table showing what programs I have tried and have luck with using an ISO for said-distro ... some programs/commands \(say ...dd) get really fussy when you try to use certain distro ISOs with them </li>
</ul>

<P> Anyway its the linking syntax that I keep getting errors with on phpmyadmin ... EACH child has a distroName field and i want to link that to the parent table ... if i have to rename the field in the child tables to say "distronNameFK" (foreign key = FK) to get this to work .. NO PROBLEM. </P>


<code>#1452 - Cannot add or update a child row: a foreign key constraint fails.... </code>

<div> is the exact error i keep getting </div>

<h2>child table - Screenshots issues/thoughts</h2>
  <h3>What I want in this table  </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>distroName - of Course </li>
      <li>SRC - local src link to jpg or png of screenshot </li>
      <li>href - link to distro's page with screenshots </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Sometimes there is a src entry ... other times href entry ... rare times both ... this display issue I have worked out ... I THINK :)
      <p>The issue I am thinking of is down the line I need to A) KNOW THE DE associated with each jpg \(for the src entry example) .. this is so i can use the same database for the DE section .. i can say "display all the plasma 5 screenshots .. REGARDLESS Of distro family, distro name ..etc " and they all display.</p>
      <p>ALSO HOW do I handle where i have a distro where I show MULTIPLE local screenshots of different DEs too  ... DATABASE setup wise .. (or spreadsheet setup wise if you want to think of it that way .. with rows as the distro names and the COLUMNS as the database fields ... its what to do with the columns for my ideas I have "webmaster's writer's block", with)</p>
